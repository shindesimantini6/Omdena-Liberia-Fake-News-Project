Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses 
scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract
knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured 
data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning 
and big data.

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis 
and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze 
actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories 
drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, 
statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information 
science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as 
a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, 
computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything 
about science is changing because of the impact of information 
technology" and the data deluge.
