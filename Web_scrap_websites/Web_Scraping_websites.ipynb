      "Urey established the All Liberian Party (ALP) in 2017 when he contested that year’s presidential election as a presidential candidate.\n",
      "This claim has made rounds on both Instagram and Facebook.\n",

      "The Cut in the 2023 Elections Budget\n",
      "Gloria Wleh\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In March this year, the Chairperson of the National Elections Commission (NEC), Madame Davidetta Browne Lansanah disclosed that the budget for the October 10, 2023 General and Presidential Elections was “adjusted by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) from US$91million to US$33million.”\n",
      "As a result of the adjustment, the Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) which should have taken place simultaneously was conducted in two faces, the Training of Trainers (TOT) which should have also been conducted for ten days was conducted for a few days, while complaints about the shortages of the BVR cards were heard across sides of the country. \n",
      "Following the announcement of the slice of the elections budget, the United States government through its Ambassador, Micheal McCarthy, called on the government of Liberia to “provide the Elections Commission with its full 2023 budget so it has the necessary resources to effectively prepare for and implement all aspects of the electoral process, or risk unfair elections in 2023.”\n",
      "Responding to the over sixty percent (60%) cut of the elections’ budget, the Communications Director of NEC, Henry Flomo said, “the budget was debated and adjusted by the government. \n",
      "The last time I checked, it was adjusted to around US$63 million or so. Cut-in elections budgets always happen. What the NEC is now doing is strategizing to work in what we have.”\n",
      "Flomo recommended that the NEC be given financial autonomy to work easily and promptly, void of adjustments.\n",
      "“The Commission has a constitutional mandate, which is to conduct elections in time. So, a lot of things will be adjusted as the cash is adjusted. But when we have control over our financial coffers, we can go there anytime to get whatever we want.”\n",
      "Flomo however urged members of the public not to panic about the credibility of the upcoming elections saying, no part of the electoral process has been stalled to endanger the nation’s democracy.\n",
      "‘There should be no reason to panic. The issue of transparency is being upheld by us. That is why we have accredited media people, civil society organizations, party agents, international people and those who want to observe or report on the registration to do so.\n",
      "“And we have not stopped any of the activity leading to the participation, or inclusion of every Liberian who has an interest in the elections. So there’s no way one would say democracy is threatened. Until those things are stopped, then one can say the democracy of the state is threatened.”\n",
      "When asked if the adjusted money allocated for this year’s elections was sufficient for the conduct of the election, Flomo responded by saying, “My boss has already spoken about that to the House of Senate.”\n",
      "Oscar Bloh is the Chairperson of the Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC). The ECC is a coalition of civic society organizations that observed elections in Liberia. \n",
      "Giving the ECC’s take on the cut of the upcoming elections budget, Bloh stated, “NEC in negotiating with the Ministry of Finance adjusted the budget. They are in the know if the budget reduction is sufficient to conduct the elections. If it wasn’t sufficient, they would have said it. Keeping silent means the money is enough.”\n",
      "The ECC  Chairperson indicated that the elections are constitutionally mandated, and it’s the government’s responsibility to provide resources for the conduct of the elections. Additionally, it is constitutionally scheduled and as such, they (the government) should have planned better.\n",
      "Oscar Bloh recounted, “the Liberia Revenue Authority on numerous occasions said it has exceeded projected revenue collection. So, the government is in a position to fund these elections. It needs to prioritize these elections, by showing its commitment and will, because it is required by law.”\n",
      "He expressed fear about the quality of the elections which is contingent on the availability of resources.\n",
      "“If resources are slow in coming, it will undermine the quality of the elections. And when the process is compromised, we run the risk of compromising the outcome,” Bloh noted.\n",
      "But there are other electoral supports from foreign nations and organizations to the NEC. The Liberia Electoral Support Project (LEDP) supports the Government of Liberia through the National Elections Commission (NEC) to conduct credible, transparent, inclusive, and peaceful elections. Also, the United Nations Elections Basket, to name a few.\n",
      "On July 30, 2021, the Embassy of Sweden in Monrovia, representing the Government of Sweden, signed an agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to contribute approximately USD  4.8 million to the Liberia Electoral Support Project (LESP) for the period from 1 August 2021 to 31 December 2024.\n",
      "Could it be, as a result of some of those technical supports that are given to the NEC, that the budget for the upcoming elections received such a huge cut? Or, it is just about the routine that election budgets should be cut almost every time by the MFDP. The world watches as the NEC leads Liberia from scratch to finish during these crucial electioneering times of the country.\n",

      "We have tracked thirty-four social media accounts that have labelled the former Vice President Joseph Boakai; Unity Party ticket as the Ritual Ticket alias (Gboyo).\n",
      "According to Liberian pidgin;  “gboyo” sells human parts. \n",
      "Political commentator and owner of the radio show “The Costa Show “ in a live podcast alleged that Nimba County Senator Jeremiah Koung is a human part seller; a statement he later retracted\n",
      "Despite the name-calling, Boakai named Koung as his VP pick in April, almost six months before the elections.\n",
      "In a radio appearance in Grand Bassa, Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR) political leader Koung debunked the claim.\n",
      "“The only time you heard about it was when it was election time. I have never paid for an abortion before, and I believe every child has the right to live. People are trying to say things in the name of politics,” Koung said.\n",
      "Koung continued, “Costa realized he was wrong when he said it, so he texted me to apologize. I am a leader, and when you are a leader, they spit on you. I have multiple children in my home, and none of them has gone missing due to ritual participation.”\n",
      "The UP VP pick thinks that the name-calling is a myth designed to divert attention away from the real issue.\n",
      "Again on June 5, he denied the claim in Nimba, stating that it was a ploy to mess with his career.\n",

      "Also, at the event marking the endorsement of President Weah’s second term bid by the lawmakers, a song was played there.\n",
      "In this music, which was performed in the presence of President Weah and all other officials of the CDC government, including House Speaker, Bhofal Chambers, Albert Tugbe Chie, CDC Chairman Mulbah Morlu and others, the musician implies that former Vice President, Joseph N. Boakai, Jeremiah K.  Koung and others were part of ritualistic killing( Gboyo).\n",
      "Part of the song says, “ We want George Weah, we don’t want no gboyo. Rescue 1 is Gboyo, rescue 2 is Gboyo all of them are Gboyo so we don’t want no Gboyo all we want is George Weah.”\n",

      "When incumbent lawmakers endorsed Liberia’s President, George Manneh Weah, he claimed (31 minutes 02 seconds) that his government has built more hospitals than the government before him.\n",
      "According to the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), the June 13 event was an endorsement of incumbent lawmakers for Weah’s re-election bid.\n",
      "This is not the first time the claim has been made. When Weah toured Montserrado County in Logan town, he told (1:21:54 seconds) citizens that he has constructed more health facilities as compared to previous governments.\n",

      "Also, the Health Sector Performance 2006-2017 Evaluation Report, published in January 2018 states that by 2005, over 90% of Liberia’s healthcare services were delivered by external agencies and NGOs and over three-quarters of the Liberian population had no access to referral health care including emergency obstetric services.\n",

      "This increased physical access to health infrastructure nationwide by 20.7% over a one-year period (2009-2010) and led to the reduction of one health facility serving an average of 8,000 of the population in 2006 to 5,500 in 2010.\n",
      "By 2017, 71% of the population lived within a 5-km radius of health facilities and County Health Teams planned, executed and constructed over 300 new facilities (Hospitals, Health Centers and Clinics,) and upgrading of others to increase to 85%. \n",

      "The figures called by Kenyor, a former supporter of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC)-led government appears interesting, and alarming, taking into account the high number of Liberians who are operating in that sector. \n",

      "Jasper pointed out that there are bikers who have simply registered with FOMTUL and are not recognized by the Liberian government.\n",
      "He said, “Any other record that does not come from the Ministry of Transport should be considered null and void.”\n",
      "Responding to queries from TSM on whether the numbers provided were the actual amount of cyclists Liberia has, the President of the Federation of Motorcyclist and Tricyclist Unions (FOMTUL) of Liberia said the figures announced during the endorsement of the standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party are numbers of motorcyclists and tricyclists registered by the leadership of FOMTUL across the fifteen (15) counties by 2023.\n",

      "Conclusion: The government of Liberia’s latest data shows a total of 14,704 numbers of motorcyclists and tricyclists are operating in the country. Therefore, John Kenyor’s claim that Liberia has over 230,000 registered motorcyclists and tricyclists is an exaggeration! It is safe to say that we did not include the motorcyclist and tricyclists who are registered with the union since Keyor refused. At the same time, it is confirmed that the union endorsed Boakai, but there is no data to show if 230,000 endorsed him.\n",

      "Full Text: On June 6, 2023, Martin Kollie posted on his Facebook page stating that Srimex had been shut down for tax evasion.\n",
      "Srimex is an oil and gas company owned by businessman and politician; Musa Hassan Bility, one of the embattled political leaders of the opposition Liberty Party (LP).\n",

      "Following the post, Bility went live on his page and cleared the air saying that the LRA closed his company (Srimex) for withholding tax and income tax that the company owes. He furthered that the LRA did not give a prior notice as they usually do but they closed the company and put the notice on the door and told the management to go to LRA to resolve it. The LRA gave the company the bill of one hundred sixty-five thousand United States dollars, he further explained. He also said that it has nothing to do with tax, as Spoon FM and Martin Kollie presented the news to the public.\n",

      "Bility filed a lawsuit against the government to the Supreme Court but was withdrawn.\n",
      "Verification: After coming across the two claims and their usual reactions, TSM’s fact-checker reached out to Danicious Kaihenneh Sengbeh, Communication officer at the Liberia Revenue Authority to verify which action the LRA took against Bility’s Srimex. \n",
      "In his reply, Sengbeh said that the LRA closed Srimex because they owed taxes and not for tax evasion as was said by Kollie.\n",
      "Tax Evasion is defined as a person claiming tax deduction or tax credit they are not entitled to or failing to report income and concealing taxable access.\n",
      "Sengbe clarified that the action was taken against the company for tax delays and not against an individual. Sengbe further explained that similar actions are routinely taken against numerous companies and businesses to recover taxes.\n",
      "Although Sengbe could not provide specific details on the amount owed by Srimex, which is known to be owned by businessman and politician  Bility, Bility himself confirmed on a Facebook broadcast that he owes US$165,000 in taxes. \n",
      "While he acknowledged that it is routine for the LRA to request access to a company’s financial records to determine tax withholdings, he expressed confusion over the decision to shut down a major company like his. “I can confirm that the action was taken in line with the LRA’s mandate. The action was taken against a company that has delayed its taxes, not an individual. Similar actions are routinely taken against many other companies and businesses to recover taxes,” Bility stated.\n",
      "in 2016, Bility was hooked for failure to settle a US$143,000 tax bill owed to the Government of Liberia (GoL).\n",
      "At the same time, Bility who is contesting in Nimba refuted claims that he received $5 Million from the fund funds\n",
      "Conclusion: After doing all of our investigations, we determined that Kollie is incorrect in claiming that Srimex was “close to tax evasion” rather than owing taxes. In this case, Srimex is closed since the institution owns income. However, because the LRA is not the same as the National Road Fund Agency, we can conclude that the closing of Srimex had nothing to do with the road fund.\n",

      "Claim: “When the Unity Party was exiting in 2017, inflation was 30%,” said Randall Dobayou, a stalwart of the CDC and Deputy Director for the Environmental Protection Agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: False. “Inflation did not hit 30% in 2017, as asserted by the speaker. Data from the World Bank, IMF and others suggest 12.44%.”\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "The debate surrounding the best platform to transform the country has taken centre stage on major radio platforms across Liberia as the crucial October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections draw closer.\n",
      "One such argument among Liberian politicians is the issue of how the economy has been managed so far and how the winner of the upcoming elections can consolidate the gains made.  \n",
      "A stalwart of the ruling establishment and deputy director for the Environmental Protection Service, Randall Dobayou, said one of the track records of the Weah administration had been macro-economic stability. \n",
      "“We all saw in this country the Unity Party exit. The inflation was at 30%. Today, according to the IMF and World Bank report, inflation is 7%. So for the economy, we have already taken giant steps,” said Dobayou as he argues Weah’s government’s priority on the OK Conversation show with two other opposition members.\n",
      "He made these statements during the show on Monday, May 29, 2023, just around 46 mins of the program. The claimant responded directly to a question about the government’s major concerns and how unique the CDC ticket is compared to others.\n",
      "Due to the weight of the claim and its biting effects on citizens, DUBAWA has seen the need to fact-check the statement.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "Inflation is a term that we use to describe rising prices. It also reflects the annual percentage change in the cost of goods and services. The consumer price index usually measures it.\n",
      "Before Weah’s election in 2017, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Havard-trained economist, presided over the country’s leadership. According to world bank data, inflation in 2017 stood at 12.4%.\n",
      "Also,  the International Monetary Fund data for Liberia’s inflation indicate that in 2017 the inflation rate was 12.4%.\n",
      "Other data sources like ‘Statista’, macrotrends have on their separate websites 12.44%  and 12.42 as Liberia’s inflation rate for the year 2017.  \n",
      "However, Checks by DUBAWA indicate that Liberia’s current inflation is 6.9 or 7%.\n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "Findings show that the assertion that Liberia’s inflation was 30% in 2017 is false.\n",

      "Liberia has over the years seen many calls coming from different national and international groupings for the equal participation of women in decision-making, especially in politics.\n",
      "Despite signing many regional and international Protocols such as the ratification of the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol, the Adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action; and the Ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, Liberian women are still lagging when it comes to politic.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, the fact that Liberia was the first African country to elect a female president in 2006 and currently has a female Vice President, gender parity still seems to be a challenge. \n",
      "A UNDP report of 2022 ranked Liberia as “156th of 162nd countries on the Gender Inequality Index, and 163 out of 185 countries on the list of women in parliaments”. The report further noted that Liberian women make up less than 11% of the 103 seats in the Legislature.\n",
      "In February 2022, “An Act to Amend Certain Sections of the New Election Law (1986) As Amended Through 2014” was passed by the Legislature.\n",
      "In March this year (2023), President George Weah vetoed several Sections of that Bill but approved amongst others, Section 4.5 b and c which state, “a political party, or coalition in its submission to the Commission, of its list of candidates for an election, should endeavour to ensure that the governing body and its list of candidates have no less than 30% of its members from each gender.”\n",
      "“A list of candidates submitted to the Commission for an election should endeavour to have no less than 30% of the candidates on the list from each gender,” accordingly.\n",
      "With the approval of this Section into law by the President of Liberia, the National Elections Commission (NEC) and twenty-five (25) registered political parties held a signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between political parties and the NEC for the full implementation of a minimum 30% gender quota for candidates listings in the 2023 general elections.\n",
      "When quizzed whether the Act approved by President Weah was not enough to achieve the 30% quota, the NEC Director of Communication Henry Flomo responded: “Well, if there was a law, there would not be a need to sign the MOU,” indicating uncertainty about the implementation of the Law.\n",
      "But during the signing ceremony on May 11, 2023, foreign and regional partners, including  Ireland, Sweden, UN Women, European Union, UNDP, and ECOWAS among others, lauded the political parties for the step taken to ensure that the 30% quota is put into effect, and called on all political parties to “turn the 30% quota MOU from paper into reality”.\n",
      "At the ceremony, NEC Chairperson, Madam Davidetta Brown Lassanah indicated that the signing of the MOU was a holistic display of a firm commitment to the inclusion of women in the new political environment.\n",
      "Madam Brown Lassanah pledged her institution’s commitment to the MOU saying, “Liberia is at a crossroads and by the signing of the MOU between political parties and the NEC, the NEC reaffirms its commitment to changing the current narrative of inequality in Liberia’s politics, to increasing the participation of women as candidates in the 2023 presidential and legislative elections”.\n",
      "The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) seeks, among other things, to create an enabling environment, and a safe space for female contestants, but most importantly, candidate listings submitted to the NEC should have a minimum of 30% of either gender for the 2023 general and presidential elections.\n",
      "Speaking on behalf of the men from the various political parties at the signing ceremony, the Chairman of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), Mulbah Morlu vowed to give the MoU their fullest support, stating, “We are taking a practical approach to the full implementation of Section 4.5 of the New Elections Law of Liberia; and we assure you of our commitments, which will be demonstrated at the national, electoral and the structural levels of our different political organizations.\n",

      "Verdict: Liberia Maritime Registry is the Second in the world, but not the best.\n",
      "Full Text: “I have to be very fair, I inherited from  Dr. Kollie a very solid program. The maritime program was very strong, so I have been building upon what I met to make it stronger. So currently, our Registry, the Liberian Registry, is the second in the world and the best in the world. and when I took over Mr. President gave me the mandate to ensure that Liberia again becomes the number one registry in the world.  And I have been working hard to ensure that as a result of that, we are climbing and climbing and the Liberian flag on the ship is being flagged very high.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The live interview attracted 242 reactions, 487 comments, 201 shares, and 7.2K viewers.\n",
      "Verification: on 17th May 2023, The Stage Media received a request from the Daily Observer Newspaper, one of Liberia’s widely read newspapers.\n",
      "The institution asked TSM to assist in fact-checking the truthfulness and accuracy of some of the claims made by Eugene Lenn Nagbe, commissioner general of the Liberia Maritime Authority when he appeared on ELBC Wednesday, May 17, 2023, to promote the agenda of President George Weah. We immediately commenced research on one of the claims he made and found that he was correct about Liberia’s Maritime Registry being the second in the world, but not the best registry in the world.\n",
      "The Liberian Registry, established in 1948 by former U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, is recognized as one of the foremost open ship and corporate registries.  During the past 61 years, the country’s commitment to safe shipping has remained steadfast. The Liberian Registry is a sovereign maritime jurisdiction responsible for the registration, regulatory enforcement, and safety of ocean-going ships. The Registry establishes identification details for ships and records legally enforceable documents, such as mortgages and bills of sale.\n",
      "The Registry is also responsible for the enforcement of maritime treaties, including Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL); and the Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). The Ship Registry runs in parallel with the Liberian Corporate Registry, which performs the same functions as the corporate registration service of any other government.\n",
      "It is established that Liberia is the second among the top ten largest flag states in the shipping industry as of April 2022. The Republic of Liberia has 4295 commercial ships operating under its flagship including 268 additional ships registered under this Flag of convenience making it the fastest-growing flag state for two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. It achieved a 9.3% growth worth 188 million gross tons as per Lloyd’s List intelligence data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarkson’s World Fleet Monitor showed that from December 2020, Liberia outran all the open registries and grew at a pace of 8.6%, evident in the shipping market as it attracted many shipowners from Greece, Japan, China, Singapore, and the United States. Hence, flag transfer tonnage accounted for 60% of its growth.\n",
      "Liberia finishes off 2020 as the world’s fastest-growing flag State for the second year in a row. In late 2018 Liberia became the second-largest flag State in the world, and since then, has continued to lead the world in fleet growth for two straight years.\n",
      "We find that the Panama Marine Authority is the world’s largest flag state. Panama is a small nation of  3 million people bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Only one shipping company is operational in the country; however, it is the largest flag state in the world with 9596 vessels sailing under its flag. Panama’s strategic location amidst crucial maritime trade routes connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through the Panama Canal allows it to have an eminent position in the world trade network.\n",
      "Most commercial ships sailing under the Panamanian flag are owned by foreigners desiring to avoid the strict maritime trade regulations of their home countries. Since Panama has an open registry, the shipowners can register easily, avoid paying income tax, employ cheap labor, and earn high profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Panama has been ranked as the top flag state in the world in 2020 according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence data. It recorded a remarkable 4.4 % growth amounting to 235 million gross tonnes compared to 2019. Around 16 per cent of the global shipping fleet is sailing under its flagship, more than the combined fleets of the US and China.\n",
      "Conclusion: While it is true that Liberia’s Maritime Registry is the second in the world and top performing, the Minister got his facts wrong when he said Liberia’s Maritime Registry is the “ BEST” in the world. We could not find any record or information to confirm the Minister’s claim that the Liberian Maritime Registry is the BEST in the world.\n",

      "“If you can’t find anything online, and you’ve reached out to experts and authorities, write what you have. In that case, you may want to manually do your search” she said.\n",
      "Cayley furthered: “You don’t necessarily need tools to do a fact-check. Just from paying keen observations on every bit of details that is in the video, or on a picture, you can do a fact-check.”\n",
      "She advised journalists to always follow the golden rule adding, “If it sounds too good to be true, leave it. Always make sure your information is coming from a trusted source.”\n",
      "She also cautions the paticipants not to settle for the first answer or result instead, they should always dig deeper if they can.\n",

      "By Mark N. Mengonfia- [email protected] \n",
      "Wednesday, May 3, 2023, social media (Facebook) had claims from different bloggers and even journalists that the Speaker Bhofal Chambers, House of Representatives, was sharing money in Maryland.\n",
      "Laso Kromah wrote “ Wow So surprise !!!!! Speaker of the house of representatives sharing money like this? \n",
      "I WILL TALK IT” \n",
      "Also, Fedel Saydee, a Liberian journalist with 12 thousand followers on Facebook wrote as I interpret.\n",
      "“You all have been asking where the money they printed went and why we are still receiving mutilated money?\n",
      "Here are some! It is in a basket and on the table in Maryland County. Ellen people did the same, and Weah people did it, we are not sure after Weah whether others won’t do it…….”\n",
      "Although Saydee has taken down the post, a screenshot which was taken 28 minutes after he posted attracted many.\n",

      "Who is Speaker Chambers?\n",
      " Speaker Chambers is the first among equals of 73 Representatives, a body that is clothed with the responsibilities of Lawmaking, Oversight, and Representation.\n",
      "He has represented Maryland Maryland County District Two since 2006. He became the Speaker of that August body in January 2018 till present. The Speaker of the House of Representatives operated on the budget of 1,485, 164 for 2020-2021 and 2,094,425 in 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker’s Budget on the Ministry of Finance website\n",
      "Verification: The Stage Media Liberia  (TSM) contacted Robert Haynes, Director of Press, House of Representatives, to verify the claims.\n",
      "Haynes in response to TSM-Liberia’s inquiry said the Speaker was responding to a request made by some market women in Maryland.\n",
      "According to Haynes, the Speaker has gone to empower the group of women who are operating a village savings loan.\n",
      "He added that the Speaker provided the sum of three hundred thousand Liberian Dollars (L$ 300, 000. 00) to the women’s group. \n",
      "The full text of his reply via messenger reads, “ The Speaker, upon request of local market women in Hospital camp, Maryland County for their village saving loan and empowerment, had gone to empower the women with three hundred thousand Liberian Dollars to start or grow their businesses.”\n",
      "The Director’s clarification that the money was a kind gesture from Chambers to the women is understandable that a man who has worked for those many years, the above-mentioned amount is years, it is a drop in the ocean for such an individual who even has an annual budget to operate.\n",
      "However, the claim that it is some of the new banknotes that were printed is true. \n",
      "All of the money in the basket and on the table are brand-new banknotes that have never been used.\n",
      "It is also safe to say that those women were paid to play the political game as posters bearing the image of the Speaker  were seen on the walls and in the hands of another person not very far from the Chambers in the background.\n",
      "Conclusion: TSM-Liberia can not independently verify if the money was three hundred thousand Liberian Dollars as claimed by Haynes. We can not also verify the claim that the money was given to market women for business purposes so, in this case, we say unverified.  \n",

Due to the implementation of the passport rule, the number of applicants for the Diversity Visa Program was reduced by 50% in 2019, 2020, and 2021 and aspiring immigrants from Africa suffered the most because of this rule.\n",
      "In 2022, a US Judge Timothy J. Kelly has rejected the previous government’s passport rule, according to which a passport was necessary for applying for the Diversity Visa Program.\n",
      " The judge granted the motion and declared that the passports were no longer necessary for the upcoming Diversity Immigrant Visa Program in 2022 (DV-2024)\n",

      "The claim furthered that Prince Y. Johnson Vows to support Unity Standard bearer.\n",
      "“Unity Party, a major opposition political party that has ruled Liberia for two successful terms under the stewardship of former President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is yet to announce its  vic presidental pick.

      "TSM reached out to him to get from the social media user the source of his information. In response, he only replied, “ Time will tell.”When TSM asked further, “Is there a link to support the claim?” Kromah agan didn’t answer.\n",

      "In Liberia, a sitting Assistant Supreme Court justice, Kabinah Ja’neh was impeached by members of the LiberianLegislature.\n",
      "The request for impeachment originated from Montserrado County District #8 lawmaker,  Acarous Moses Gray who chairs the Houses Committee on Executive and from the Ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC).\n",
      "The process of impeachment went on for weeks and a final ruling was made,but it was questioned by Liberians and some of the very lawmakers from the Liberian Senate who publicly showed their opposition.\n",
      "On the other hand, the man who was impeached, Kabinah Ja’neh, did not accept the ruling from the Supreme Court of Liberia.\n",
      "He spoke of irregularities during his impeachment process. Ja’neh then took an appeal to the ECOWAS Court for redress, a request which was granted him by that regional Court.\n",
      "The ECOWAS Court mandated the government of Liberia to pay the sum of Two-Hundred Thousand (200,000.00) United States Dollars to former Associate Justice, Kabinet Ja’neh for what it called “wrongfully” impeaching him; said money and the mandate from that ECOWAS Court are yet to be obeyed by the Liberian Government.\n",
      "Verification:Article 42 of Liberia’s 1986 Constitution titled impeachment states that, “The power to prepare a bill of impeachment is vested solely in the house of representative and the power to try all impeachments is vested solely in the senate. \n",
      "“When the president, vice president or an associate justice of the supreme court is to be tried, the chief justice shall preside; when the chief justice or judge of a subordinate court of record is to be tried, the president of the senate shall preside. No person shall be impeached, but by the concurrence of two-thirds of the total membership of the senate.!\n",
      "“Judgment in such cases, shall not extend beyond removal from office or disqualification  to hold public office in the republic, but the party may be tried at law for the same offense. The legislature shall prescribe the procedure for impeachment proceedings which shall be in conformity with the requirements of due process of law.”\n",
      "Interpreting this provision of the law, Cllr. Amara Sheriff, a Liberian Lawyer said the president has no such power to impeach a justice or judge of a court of records even though he appoints them.\n",
      "“It is not near possible for a president to take such a decision; by the time you appoint the person it will be finished. You cannot appoint a justice or judge because he or she does not support you and you say you want to impeach them. The whole issue with impeachment is done by the house (legislature) based upon substantial evidence or proof as in the case of Judge Richards Klah, former Commercial Court Judge. \n",
      "Judge Klah resigned while the legislature was in the process of impeaching him for ethical misconduct. The house of Representative can begin an impeachment proceeding of a Judge or Justice for a cause that runs contrary to his or her duty, while the house of senate preside over the trial as jurors of the fact where both accused and accuser will face each other. \n",
      "Sheriff added: “Impeachment is premised upon proven  misconduct, but not based on President Weah’s wish to impeach a  judge or justice.”\n",
      "Conclusion: No, the power to impeach a Judge or Justice does not lie with the president, rather the Liberian Legislature. It begins with the House of Representatives and ends with the Senate. Therefore, the claim by Laso Kromah that President Weah wants to impeach the judge of the Supreme Court bench is Incorrect.\n",

      "The Stage Media-Liberia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, Liberia was one of the first countries in West Africa to introduce the manual Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system in elections.\n",
      "OMR reads and captures data marked on a particular type of document form. In most instances, this form consists of a bubble or a square filled in as part of a test or survey. This was the system that was used during Liberia’s elections.\n",
      "As the country goes to the polls on October 10, 2023, the voter’s registration is being conducted through a biometric voter registration (BVR) system, migrating from the manual Optical Mark Recognition (OMR).\n",
      "The BVR is the process by which people are enlisted onto a voter registration by submitting information that includes their biometrics such as iris, face, and fingerprints.\n",
      "The technology is deployed to detect voter fraud, such as duplicate registrations.\n",
      "The BVR process started on March 20, 2023, and is expected to run in two phases until May 11, 2023. \n",
      "Phase one of the registration exercise kickstarted on March 20, for twenty-one days, in six of the country’s fifteen counties, including; Bomi, Gbarpolu, Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount, Margibi, and Montserrado Counties. \n",
      "Phase two will run from April 21, 2023, to May 11, 2023, in the remaining nine counties, including Bong, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Maryland, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe Counties.\n",
      "As the National Election Commission (NEC) takes the BVR to remote villages, many Liberians, including politicians, have expressed fear because there have been a lot of complaints from day one of the registration processes.\n",
      "The fear of NEC’s inability to conduct the BVR existed before the process because the commission was unprepared to use the introduced system.\n",
      "However, NEC ignored these calls and started the BVR process. Since the beginning of the BVR in those first counties, citizens have expressed disappointment over the slow procedure.\n",
      "An extension was requested by both politicians and ordinary citizens but was denied by the NEC Chairperson, who insisted that the process would go on as planned.\n",
      "Joseph N. Boakai, political leader of the opposition Unity Party, during the signing of the Farmington River Declaration to support peaceful elections in Liberia, spoke about reports of technical problems that were causing delays in the registration process.\n",
      "Among those problems, Boakai named printers assigned to registration centers going off frequently, \n",
      "shortage of cards used to produce voter ID cards, and the time it takes the solar panel to generate power from the sun.\n",
      "He said, “The above factors are leading to a long stay in queues without registration of people who want to register and participate in the determination of the country’s next leader. Some have even hinted that they are tired and may not return to the registration centers.”\n",
      "“We call on the National Elections Commission to consider extending the registration process in the first six counties. This is intended to make up for the delays and technical problems that have led to many not being able to register. Not doing so will be an act of deliberately disenfranchising Liberian citizens from participating in the elections,” Boakai stressed.\n",
      "Contrary to Boakai’s accusation, Davidetta Brown-Lassanah, NEC Chairperson, has expressed optimism in the BVR exercise, despite the process’s challenges.\n",
      "According to Brown-Lassanah, the start of everything new can be challenging.\n",
      "“As with the introduction of every technology, it is not unusual for glitches to occur at the initial stages. These challenges are not peculiar to Liberia. Indeed, similar cases have been reported in other countries which, despite the initial glitches, ended up having very successful registration drives”, she noted.\n",
      "The first stage of the process has ended as training to kickstart phase two is in progress.\n",

      "The post attracted 2.9K individuals, 453 comments, and 45 shares.\n",
      "Verification: TSM checked the lady’s name and her degree. We established that the name of the lady in the picture is Sharon Mbabazi of Uganda and not Agatha, as the blog post. \n",
      "As to the claim of her being a Mass Communication student, the blog is correct.\n",
      "Sharon earned a Mass-communication degree from Muteesa I Royal University in Mengo in 2018; The Observer published Mbabazi’s fantastic lifestyle, which defies gender and cultural biases in Uganda. \n",
      "This was after Sharon Mbabazi made a simple Facebook post showcasing her brickmaking skill, becoming an overnight sensation. \n",

      "Many societies regard brickmaking as an old-fashioned menial activity for energetic, uneducated men who have lost hope in getting tough jobs. It is also dirty and physically demanding, as one’s primary raw material is mud; seeing a young woman engage in such was shocking.\n",
      "Her mother’s death in 2005 opened Mbabazi’s life up to the harsh realities of poverty. The third-born in a family of five, she recalls being in P2 at the time, and her father warned them to brace for a tough life. She has had a troubled school life; she was always sent home for lack of fees or educational materials. Her elder siblings dropped out of school, but Mbabazi completed A-level in 2014.\n",

      "Full text: Liberia has been against same-sex marriage since it became a country.\n",
      "The Penal Law of Liberia, dated as far back as 1976, prohibited same-sex. The law criminalizes acts of ‘sodomy,’ broadly defined. This provision carries a maximum penalty of one-year imprisonment. Both men and women are criminalized under this law.\n",
      "Also, in November of 2018, a bill was introduced to amend the Penal Code to criminalize ‘same-sex practices.’ It was not discussed before the legislature went on recess in December.\n",
      "In 2012, A bill that would further criminalize ‘homosexual behavior’ was passed by the Liberian Senate, although former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf vetoed the instrument.\n",
      "One of the famous slogans Liberians know is “Liberia was founded on a Christian principle,” a belief they have to the point that some Liberians see the nation drafting from its “ Christian” national principles. Efforts were made by a Church group under the banner of Liberia Restoration to Christian Heritage Committee (LRCHC) on Tuesday, March 19, 2013, petitioned the Liberian Legislature to Christianize Liberia from its current secular state.\n",
      "The group solicited over 700,000 signatures from across the country to amend specific provisions of the 1986 Constitution of Liberia to give the Christian religion an exclusive religious right.\n",
      "In the face of all these requests from the citizens of Liberia through their lawmakers, international partners who protect the rights of all humans have, on the other hand, been in the advocacy to ensure the sexual orientation rights of those who believe in the act of same-sex are respected.\n",
      "Recently, a delegation from Liberia headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah attended a Democracy Summit in Lusaka, Zambia.\n",
      "They had discussions on many things, including democracy.\n",
      "At the end of their discussion, a communique was signed by the 76 countries that attended the Summit in Lusaka. \n",
      "The communique, with many counts, highlighted rights to freedom of democracy, combating authoritarian trends, civil and political rights, and the progressive realization of economic, social, and cultural rights.\n",
      "Count eight of the document was evident when it spoke to protecting the sexual orientation of all persons. \n",
      "Count eight states, “To promote respect for human rights and equality for all individuals and combat all forms of discrimination and exclusion on any grounds, consistent with international human rights law, including multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including based on gender, race, ethnicity, color, religion or belief, national or social origin, property, birth, indigeneity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy, political opinion, class, genetic information, or age, and promote inclusion and the full and equal participation of all individuals in marginalized or vulnerable situations, including internally displaced persons.”\n",
      "A newspaper, The Independent Probe Liberia, published this information on its website. At the same time, it was also found here and here, “ Breaking News: Weah’s CDC Government Signed Gay Right.\n",
      "The “sycophantic” and “hypocritical” supporters and propagandists of Weah’s CDC government should please go tell the Liberian peepo dah [people that]   Weah government approved for men them to be having sex wif deh boy chayren and women dem to be having sex wif deh geh chayren[ sex with the boys children and women them to be having sex with girls children].\n",
      "Instead of focusing on the issues of development and the laws regarding pedophilia, Rape, sexual abuse, gender violence, etc., people want to use Obed Obed lies to label a man who has been very clear that he is not gay, has been married for 41 years, and has children & grandchildren”.\n",
      "To verify the claim, TSM sent two WhatsApp messages [April 3 and 4, 2023] to Liberia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah, requesting a clear understanding of whether the Liberia delegation signed any document that commits Liberia to gay rights.\n",
      "Although the Ministry saw the two messages but has not replied.\n",
      "If we do get comments from them, this article will be updated.\n",
      "Also, a media executive, Malcolm W. Joseph, who attended the conference, was contacted on April 3, 2023, requesting similar clarity. He, too, is yet to reply to the inquiry made by TSM.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Liberia’s Ministry of Information, Culture Affairs, and Tourism, Legdgerhood Julius Rennie, on April 4, 2023, appeared on State Radio, LBS, and said the information was fake and misleading, despite  Liberia ever signing the said document.\n",
      "The Liberian Minister said the discussion held at the Summit was about democracy, and nothing about Gay rights was discussed as was claimed by the newspaper.\n",
      "All research and requests to get a document copy did not materialize.\n",
      "Conclusion: With the information gathered thus far from the Independent Probe Newspaper’s publication and the refusal of Minister Kermaya and others to speak to the claim coupled with a statement from the Minister of Information, we can only say the claim is unverified.\n",

      "On January 13, 2023, the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) took to its official Facebook page to highlight the numerous achievements President George Weah made during five years. It was cited that “President George Weah increased the army budget by US$4 million in FY 2022.”\n",
      "Ministry of Information Cultural (MICAT)’s post about the AFL first under section 11, themed: “PUBLIC SAFETY & NATIONAL SECURITY,” attracted 172 reactions, 166 comments and 117 as of March 1, 2023, with commenters having mixed views about the post.\n",
      "But did it mean that MICAT’s post about the army’s budgetary increment was also a great booster to the AFL operations?\n",
      "DUBAWA verified facts surrounding the ministry’s claim and further ascertained what the increment meant for the military.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "The fiscal year (FY) 2022 of the Armed Forces of Liberia (ALF) was examined by DUBAWA, and it revealed that the AFL, which is a department under the direction and supervision of the Ministry of National Defense, was budgetarily allocated US$16,361,844m of the US$18,695,921m the Defense Ministry received that year.\n",
      "To verify the actual figure of the army’s budget was increased in FY 2022, DUBAWA checked the FY 2020-2021, and it shows that the AFL got US$13,480,633m of the US$14,412,445 the Ministry of National Defense received.\n",
      "Also, in 2021, a “Special National Budget, Fiscal Year 2021” was passed, and on that budget, the AFL received US$2,464,633m of the US$7,853,070m that was given to the Defense Ministry. \n",
      "In 2022, the ALF was allocated US$16,361,844m of the US$18,695,921m the Defense Ministry received.\n",
      "Screenshot of the AFL budget.\n",
      "This researcher then visited the legislative budget office (LBO), a technical arm of the legislature that provides an objective, impartial, and professional analysis of the national budget, to establish if the 2021 Special Budget is also a part of the 2020-2021 FY, and they clarified that “the  Special National Budget, Fiscal Year 2021, which ran from July 2021 to December 2021, was a budget year all by itself and cannot be combined with any other budget year.”\n",
      "The AFL’s FY 2020-2021 budget was then subtracted from the FY 2022 budget, and the math resulted in a US$2,881,211m increment, contrary to MICAT’s claim that the army’s budget was increased by $4 million in FY 2022.\n",
      "This researcher reached out to the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Liberia (AFL), Major General Prince Johnson, to have him speak to MICAT’s claim and the content of the budget. Still, Gen Johnson stated, “When we say our budget was increased by $4 million in FY 2022, we meant the Ministry of National Defense, which includes: Central Administration, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia Coast Guard; not specifically the AFL.”\n",
      "Subtracting the Ministry of National Defense FY 2020-2021 from their FY 2022 showed that FY 2022 increased by US$4,283,476m.\n",
      "But what did the increase mean for the ALF?\n",
      "The Chief of Staff explained that “the increment of the army’s FY 2022 budget boosted the operations of the ALF through recruitment of more AFL personnel, promotions of the institution, and renovations of our barracks.”\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The FY 2022 budget reveals that the Ministry of National Defense budget was increased by US$ 4 million and not the AFL. Therefore, MICAT’s claim that “President George Weah increased the army’s budget by US$4 million in FY 2022” is misleading.\n",

      "On the University of Liberia campus on March 13, there were clashes between student organizations and lawmakers. The conflict erupted when Montserrado County District #8 Representative Acarous Gray stormed the main campus of the University of Liberia (UL) to settle scores with the leadership and members of the campus-based Student Unification Party (SUP).\n",
      "The invasion, resisted by hardliners known as militants, resulted in a heated hour-long stone-throwing skirmish in which several people were injured. \n",
      "The lawmaker, who had gone under the pretense of eating lunch on the campus of the country’s top public university, was reportedly enraged by SUP militants harassing ruling-party allies thought to be corrupt government employees.\n",

      "Full Text: Police Inspector General Patrick Sudue appeared before the Liberia Senate on February 28 to answer several security inquiries. During the appearance, he disclosed that the police–to–population ratio is 1:1,700.\n",
      "The Liberian National Police (LNP) is the frontline force of internal security in the fight against crimes, protecting life and property, and maintaining the rule of law, as directed by its statute.\n",
      "U.N. peacekeepers went into Liberia in 2003 to stabilize the country after years of civil war led to a collapse of the state.\n",

      "In 2009, the United Nations recorded that 3,800 officers were trained in modern policing methods and techniques.\n",
      "Also, a 2013 report named “No Money, No Justice” said the Liberia National Police (LNP) stands at 4,417 police officers.\n",

      "Sweden contributed forty million Swedish Krona (SEK 40 million), approximately US$4,670,000 over the four years of the project implementation, while UNFPA contributed US$675,600.\n",
      "The project aimed to increase young people’s awareness and skills regarding their sexual and reproductive health and rights in Liberia’s southern counties, including Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Maryland, and River Gee.\n",
      "It established an enabling atmosphere for the respect and fulfilment of the sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people, consequently helping to reduce the high prevalence of teenage pregnancies in Liberia.\n",
      "Also, on August 18  2020, the Embassy of Sweden and the United Nations Population Fund signed an agreement for Sweden’s contribution of forty-three million Swedish Krona (SEK 43,000), approximately US$4.9 million to support UNFPA Country Program document for Liberia over the next four and half years.\n",
      "The current UNFPA Country Program for Liberia (2020-2024) is fully aligned with the Government of Liberia’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) 2018-2023.\n",
      "It aims to help achieve the goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHRs) by ensuring that women, adolescents, and youth, especially those who are marginalized and far behind, have improved access to high-quality, gender-responsive, comprehensive, and integrated services.\n",

Age-specific fertility rates peak at age 20–24 (193 births per 1,000 women) and are lowest among young women younger than 15 (4 births per 1,000 women) and women aged 45–49 (16 births per 1,000 women).\n",

      "“The lady you are talking about, I don’t know her.” I live in Brewerville. From my work area, I go home. I don’t know anything about the counselor.”\n",
      "Verification: After the incident, it is a fact that Tarlee made his first appearance after the alleged incident on February 27—four days after the accusation by Cllr. Verdier in a live podcast.\n",
      "Tarlee was invited by police, at which time he confirmed his absence during his child’s naming ceremony on Sunday, February 26, 2023, at his residence in Brewerville.\n",
      "When asked by reporters why he wasn’t present to bring his child out during the naming ceremony as his tradition required, he said that he was unable to attend due to eye trouble. \n",

      "When businessman and political leader of the opposition Movement for Progressive Change (MPC), Simeon Freeman, appeared on OK FM on February 27, he made several claims.\n",
      "Freeman is rallying support for opposition collaboration as the country’s Presidential and Legislative Election is in October.\n",
      "According to him, a-one opposition can defeat President George Weah, who is seeking re-election for a second term.\n",
      "Freeman has contested two elections, mainly in 2011 and 2017, and results show that he didn’t make the top five.\n",
      "We look at the claims made by Freeman during his radio appearance.\n",
      "1.       Liberia has the highest capacity population density in Africa\n",
      "a.       37 percent of the population lives in the capital city.\n",
      "b.       Monrovia population is 1.6 Million\n",
      "c.       All other African countries have 10-15 percent of their people in the capital city.\n",
      "According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2022 report, there are two categories in which African cities are clustered: size or density.\n",
      "Some clusters are dense, having cities near one another, although they might not have many cities. Some sets include a similar number of cities but may not be as thick due to the cities’ slightly greater separation.\n",
      "There are a few vast, dense groups. They have a large number of nearby cities. A compact city cluster is where at least 2.5 million urban dwellers reside in towns with more than 30 000 inhabitants no more than 100 road kilometers apart.\n",
      "A sizeable urban cluster is defined as a region where at least 10 million urban residents live in cities with more than 30 000 inhabitants within 250 kilometers of each other. An expansive city cluster can include one or more compact clusters.\n",
      "The report named Egypt the largest cluster of cities along the Nile and within its delta. It is one of the few examples of a compact city cluster with a vast population. It is home to more than 80% of Egypt’s population, with 82 million urban dwellers.\n",
      "Egypt also contains six more cities with more than one million population.\n",
      "In addition to Cairo, the second-largest compact city cluster consists of cities in Nigeria and Benin, specifically Lagos, Ibadan, and Cotonou. According to the African Development Bank, it boasts 33 million urban dwellers, despite having no other cities with populations greater than one million.\n",
      "While the largest expansive city cluster covers West African cities from Kumasi (Ghana) in the west to Kano (Nigeria).\n",
      "The Business Insider Africa said Lagos, Nigeria, is the most populated city in Africa, followed by D.R. Congo and Egypt.\n",
      "In 2021, Mauritius was named as having the highest population density by Statista, while World Bank named Guinea Bissau in 2020 and DR Congo in 2021.\n",
      "Conclusion: Liberia does not have the highest capacity population density in Africa.\n",
      "1a. No, 37 percent of the population does not live in the capital city. Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, was founded in 1822 by formerly enslaved people from the United States of America and was named after US president James Monroe.\n",
      "It is located on a hilly peninsular between the Mesurado river and the Atlantic Ocean on the West Coast of Africa. The Mesurado River separates the mainland from Bushrod and Balli islands.\n",
      "In 1986, the population of Monrovia was estimated at around 572,000 inhabitants. This number peaked at the height of the civil war; between 1990 – 2004, the people of Monrovia were reported to have doubled to over 1,000,000, according to City Alliance.\n",
      "Monrovia is considered a primate city, although it is more accurately a census district comprising the city of Monrovia, the city of Paynesville, eight townships, and one borough in the UN Habitat 2020 report.\n",
      "With a population exceeding 1.3 million, representing nearly 29 percent of the national population, Monrovia is the hub of the country’s administrative, economic, and transport activities.\n",
      "The World Bank reported Monrovia’s population at 30 percent in 2021.\n",
      "1b. Exaggeration, the population in Monrovia is not 1.6 Million; the UN-Habitat 2020 report puts the number at 1.3 million, while the World Bank 2021 report says 1.5 million.\n",
      "The Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) announced the provisional results of its 2022 National Population and Housing Census.\n",
      "Acting head of LISGIS, Lawrence George, said: “The de facto Population in Liberia on Census Night [November 10-11, 2022] was 5.2 million (5,248,621). The total population increased by 1,772,013 (50 percent) [when] compared to the 2008 census.\n",
      "George said the provisional results show Montserrado County accounts for 37 percent of the total population enumerated, but there has not been an official percentage for Monrovia.\n",
      "1c. All other countries have 10-15 percent of their population in the capital city. No, it’s incorrect. The World Bank named seven countries below 10-15 percent of its population residing in its capital cities.\n",

      "Claim: A WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell claims that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: False. The WhatsApp link claiming that Shell offers jobs for 2023 is fake and misleading. The Link, upon verification, is not for the official company.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "A WhatsApp message containing a link to a website purporting to be the British multinational oil and gas company Shell states that the company offers jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers.\n",
      "A screenshot of the WhatsApp message.\n",
      "Once you open the link in the WhatsApp message, it takes you to a website, and the front page shows an image of individuals wearing the reflected work suit and the company logo. \n",
      "The site also contains an application form with questions such as “Select Title, Your First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email address, and Country.”\n",
      "It is important to note that however applicants answer these questions, they will be directed to another step which automatically “congratulates” and qualifies the applicant to work with the company. When the steps are completed, applicants are again asked to share the link with “five people or 15 friends on WhatsApp.” After the green verification bar is filled, he or she will also be redirected automatically to the company’s appointment page.\n",
      "Applicants are also told that after these processes, they will receive a confirmation email within 24 hours after a successful application.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "ScamAdviser.com, a verification tool used to certify the originality of websites and links, was used to analyse the authenticity of links. Upon analysis, findings show that the alleged Shell website was suspicious and was rated with a “very bad trust” tag and flagged up as a link associated with scammers.\n",
      "A screenshot of a fact-check report conducted by the researcher on ScamAdviser.\n",
      "Further research established that the website of the British multinational company Shell Group of Companies does not carry anything like “TABNAIJA” in its URL. The Company does have jobs for skilled and unskilled labourers on their website, but the requirements for these jobs are not to fill out an application form and are in contrast to what was specified on the false link. The real company is also aware of these scam alerts. It has issued a caution on its website about people or sites claiming to be offering jobs at their company. \n",
      "“Please note that Shell Group of companies (nor any of the organisations that recruit on our behalf) never ask for any money or payments from applicants at any point in the recruitment process. All individuals who successfully gain an offer of employment from a Shell Group company, whether directly or indirectly, are always required to undergo a formal recruitment process. All communications should originate from a verifiable Shell e-mail address and not from an Internet e-mail address, e.g., Hotmail, yahoo etc.”   \n",
      "Recruitment scams \n",
      "According to the Shell Group company’s official site, the fraud scam section states: \n",
      "“The job offers come from organisations falsely pretending to recruit on behalf of Shell Group companies or by people claiming to work for or be affiliated to a Shell Group company. These propositions notify individuals that their qualifications were found suitable to work as an employee (local or expatriate) for a Shell Group company and solicit the transfer of significant sums of money to pay for work permits, insurance policies, etc.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, the company asks those wanting to seek jobs from them to consider that they do not request money from applicants at any point in the recruitment process.\n",
      "Internet users are cautioned against opening these viral links.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Based on research, our finding reveals the link in the WhatsApp message has a URL that contains words such as “tabnaija,” which cannot be found anywhere in the original link of Shell Group. \n",
      "It has the potential to compromise people’s private information, meaning some webpages, like that of the purported Shell Oil and Gas recruitment site, is a risk to personal devices and may interfere with the privacy of individuals who access them at any given point. At times, it may encrypt viruses in their devices, scam them or infuse malware or virus in devices. \n",

      "Census involves the complete enumeration of the population of a country. It shows the number of household members, tribal groups, and religions.\n",
      "Its results are used to impact programs, planning, and policies for the welfare of the development of a country.\n",
      "Article 39 of the 1986 constitution of Liberia states that “the Legislature shall cause a census of the Republic to be undertaken every ten (10) years.” Since its independence in 1847, according to the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LIGIS), Liberia has conducted four censuses, with 1,016 in 1962, 1,503 in 1974, 2,102 in 1984, and 3,477 in 2008, respectively.\n",
      "By law, the next census was expected to have been conducted in 2018. Still, according to the United Nations Missions in Liberia’ (UNMIL) February 21, 2018 report, which was extracted from the Daily Observer, “the House of Representatives and the Senate decided to postpone the March 26, 2018, scheduled national census to an undetermined future date because the government cannot raise its share of 50 per cent of the USD20 million needed to carry out the national census.”\n",
      "Controversy over postponement\n",
      "The new date for the organisation of the country’s census was not without controversy.\n",
      "An AllAfrica August 31, 2022, report explained that “the Liberian Senate, after a lengthy plenary discussion on June 16, 2022, moved the census to March 18 to 30, 2023, pending a concurrence by the House of Representatives, although the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) had proposed 16 to October 28 2022 for the conduct of the 2022 census.”\n",
      "The report also showed that on July 25, 2022, International Partners, including ECOWAS and the United Nations, wrote a letter that was signed by UN Resident Coordinator Niels Scott and co-signed by Finance & Development Planning Minister Samuel D. Tweah, Jr., who chairs LISGIS board, advising President Weah about the financial implications and ramifications if the census is postponed to March 2023.\n",
      "The partners argued that the obligatory payments to census staff would be negatively impacted if the census is delayed further. \n",
      "They indicated the postponement would also affect the loan agreement between Liberia and Ghana regarding providing 21,000 tablets and power banks, respectively.\n",
      "The partners also warned about donor fatigue regarding the payment of nearly US$800,000 if the census isn’t held in October. A postponement to December means the government and its partners must raise US$2 million amid global economic challenges.\n",
      "In total, more than US$8.8 million would have been lost if the census wasn’t held in October,” the report indicated.\n",
      "On August 10, 2022, President George Weah formally wrote to Members of the 54th Legislature to convene a Special or Extraordinary Session for 30 days to discuss, among many things, “the setting of a new census date.” \n",
      "A Daily Observer report quoted President Weah as saying, “the postponement of the Census from October 2022 to November 2022 will create an added staff cost of US$139,000; December 2022, is staff cost of US$278,000; and in March 2023, a staff cost of US$695,000. \n",
      "Through south-south cooperation, the Government of Ghana loaned the Government of Liberia 21,000 electronic data collection tablets and accessories, which will be returned at the end of October 2022.\n",
      "If the census were not in October 2022, these devices would be returned, and the Government of Liberia will have to purchase its electronic tablets at US$5,355,000. Also, the financial commitment by donors may not be fulfilled if the census was not conducted in October 2022,” the President noted.\n",
      "On September 15, 2022, President George Weah signed into law a Joint Resolution of the National Legislature for the conduct of the National Housing and Population Census, following a joint resolution from the Senate and House of Representatives authorizing the Executive Branch of Government to conduct the National Census from October 24 to November 7, 2022.\n",
      "But according to an October 21, 2022, publication of the Daily Observer Newspaper report, with just four days to kick off the fifth and first digital National Population and Housing Census (NPHC), on October 20 2022, the census was postponed by 15 days following a consensual decision reached during a leadership meeting with authorities of the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) and the head of Liberia’s Census Fund the UNFPA. As a result, President Weah, by proclamation, declared Friday, November 11, 2022, as “National Census Day,” and it was observed throughout the Republic as a National Holiday.\n",
      "The date is fixed; thus, new challenges set in\n",
      "November 22, 2022, Frontpage Africa publication authored that “the initial ten days stipulated for the conduct of the 2022 national population and housing census elapsed, but only 40,027 people, representing less than five per cent of the estimate, were  counted.”\n",
      "The slow pace of the counting, according to LISGIS, was mainly due to “logistical challenges and difficulties in reaching hard-to-reach counties in the Southeast,” the report added.\n",
      "DUBAWA spoke with a few Liberians about what they make of the drama surrounding the 2022 national census and how they feel about the entire exercise:  \n",
      "“I feel awful about how this whole census business is going. After they told us to stay home, my house of six human beings has not even been counted. I don’t trust whatever result LIGIS may come up with, and I’m not interested because the news outside there has not been so encouraging,” Benaweh Harris, a Towel Hill, Margibi County resident, said.\n",
      "A resident of Central Monrovia, Alice Weegar, also stated, “they never count my children and me. They only came to my house and marked it. Since they left, they haven’t come back to count us. They’re not doing well at  all.”\n",
      "Apart from the difficulties in getting people to count, there were also many discrepancies, complaints about corruption, frustrations, disenchantments and misunderstanding that characterised the 2022 census process. \n",
      "Enumerators and supervisors have protested across the country and expressed distrust in the conduct of the census. The former Acting Director General of LIGIS, Wilmot Smith and his Deputy, Alex Williams, were sacked by President George Weah on November 14, 2022, on administrative grounds. \n",
      "The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC), however, on June 16, 2022, issued its “Final Report on LISGIS Corruption Investigation.”\n",
      "The LACC report, in its nine-count findings and analysis, showed that the  Director General of LISGIS, Francis Wreh, his Deputy Director General for Administration, Lawrence George, former Deputy Director General for Information Coordination Wilmot-Smith, among other high-ranking officials, made several illegal monetary transactions intended for the National Housing and Population Census (NHPC), for which their prosecutions were recommendation by the LACC.\n",
      "Census results and matters arising\n",
      "Justina Harris, the Communication Director of LIGIS, disclosed to DUBAWA through a telephone interview on Thursday, January 19, 2023, that “by next week, the provisional results will be out. \n",
      "As for the final results, it will take months before they can be out because a lot of things still need to be done,” she stated.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in a WhatsApp call interview with DUBAWA on February 4, 2022, former Deputy Director General for Statistics and Data Processing of LISGIS, Alex Williams, said, “corruption took the total stage while I was at LISGIS. I wrote multiple communications about the situation, but there was no result, and so, on November 12, 2022, I tendered my letter of resignation to the board of directors of LIGIS. Unfortunately, on November 14, two days after I resigned, I saw on the Executive Mansion that I was dismissed.”\n",
      "Williams, who labelled the 2022 census as “a flaw, failure and an embarrassment to Liberia,” stated, “the census results could not have been announced the time it should have because there are no real results and people have to take time to manipulate the results by adding random numbers.”\n",
      "“I want to tell the folks at LIGIS to be honest to the Liberian people and tell them that they (LISGIS) haven’t done a good job. The Liberian people themselves shouldn’t accept any result coming from LISGIS. The new government should conduct a new census that would be more scientific, legitimate and realistic,” Williams indicated.  \n",
      "He explained that “one of the fundamental reasons why the census is conducted is to impact programs, planning and policies for the welfare of the development of the country.” \n",
      "“The census results should be utilised for setting a threshold, after which the National Elections Commission (NEC) should use for electoral constituency demarcation before voter registration. That constitutional provision also will not be satisfied in the upcoming elections because of the timing and the inept nature of those at LIGIS. This could lead to the manipulation of census results for political reasons,” Williams averred.\n",
      "                                                                                                                                                         Gloria Wleh\n",

      "Our source disclosed that Alexander Cummings of the Alternative National Congress (ANC) has  accepted to go as running mate to former Vice President Joseph Boakai for the Presidential ensuing Election.\n",
      "According to our source, Mr. Cummings accepted the offer based on several conditions including equity distribution of jobs among the two parties and most importantly for the Former VP to run for only one term thus giving the ANC the opportunity to lead.\n",
      "The supporters of the both men have had bad blood for each other from the deformation of the CPP , where one party accused the other of tempering with their framework document.”\n",

      "Similarly, we contacted Mohammed Ali, former secretary general Unity Party, to confirm the information. He also terms the information as false and says there has been no discussion of such to the best of his knowledge.\n",
      "We also checked the official facebook pages of Boakai’s  and Cummings, and we found no such information to confirm the claim.\n",
      "Recently, Boakai, in a VOA interview, said one political party could not defeat President George Weah, who is contesting for the second term.\n",
      "Boakai stressed the need for the opposition community to form a common front.\n",
      "Meanwhile,  Boakai and r Cummings remain the forerunners in the opposition. However, their chances of replacing incumbent Weah depend not on their formidability but on the strength of the ticket they forge. Some believe only a Boakai-Cummings ticket can unseat the incumbent.\n",
      "In a piece of analysis, Taa Wongbe, former aide to Cummings, said that what the Liberian people want as an alternative to Weah is a Boakai-Cummings ticket.\n",
      "He noted that Cummings could not win the 2023 elections alone, especially with Boakai in the race. He called on Cummings to prove his love for country by seconding Boakai for unseating Weah in October.\n",
      "“CDC’s first 200,000 votes will come from Montserrado. Boakai’s first 200,000 votes will come from Montserrado and Lofa. No one knows where Cummings first 100,000 votes will come from,” he said.\n",

      "In his State of the Nation Address in 2023, President George Weah stated that his administration had boosted fiscal assistance for the General Auditing Commission and the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC).\n",
      "He claims the LACC would receive the most significant financing share in its history in the projected 2023 budget.\n",
      "“My Government has increased budgetary support to both the General Auditing Commission and the LACC. In the proposed budget, the LACC will receive the highest share of funding it has ever had in its history.”\n",

      "Full text: Naymote, a Civil Society Organization (CSO), recently released a report that captured the promises of President George M. Weah; another report showed the workings of the legislative branch of the Liberian government.\n",
      "It detailed the number of promises made by President Weah, the ones he has achieved, and those that are yet to be fulfilled. \n",
      "Also, the institution looked deep into the Legislature with a focus on many other things, including the ratio of men to women, the number of legislation passed by both houses, the budget of the Legislature, and the number of public and secret sessions held.\n",
      "After the report on the Legislature, the Director of Communication at the House of Representatives, Robert Haynes, in a phone conversation on Truth FM State of the Nation Talk Show, termed the report false.\n",
      "During the appearance of the Naymote team, who claimed that the Liberian Legislature does not have a website was when Haynes phoned in.\n",
      "Naymote said despite substantial financial support to the Legislature, the body does not have any regular (official) publications on its activities or an active, official website for public information. \n",
      "However, Naymote recommends that the Liberian Legislature set up a functional website and ensure voting records are made public.\n",
      "In response to Naymote’s January 25, 2023, radio appearance, Haynes said the report was untrue.\n",
      "He claims Naymote’s report  is to satisfy donor partners “The  institution haveto  write anything they want to write about the legislature.”\n",
      "When asked about the official website of the Liberian Legislature, Mr. Haynes said the functional website of the Liberian Legislature is www.legislatureofliberia.com.\n",
      "He also pointed out the Legislature’s Facebook page, which provides prompt public information.\n",
      "TSM researched the link www.legislatureofliberia.com, and it took us to several associations, including Wikipedia, WorldAtlas, Executive Mansion, and the Liberiainfo.\n",
      "We reached out to Facebook and established that the Liberian Senate has its own Facebook page with 4.5 thousand followers. The House of Representatives also has a Facebook page with 5.1 thousand followers.\n",
      "Conclusion: With the study completed, it is reasonable to claim that the House of Representatives director of press misrepresented the facts. The Legislature does not have a functioning website. However, the House of Representatives does have a Facebook page. In addition, neither chamber of the Legislature has a single Facebook profile that has all of their information (Representative and Senate)\n",

      "President George Manneh Weah, in his sixth State of Annual Address for his first term, made these claims about inflation and the economy:\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Liberia is a macroeconomic exception in the West African region.\n",
      "We have brought inflation down from a high of thirty (30%) percent to a single-digit rate now under seven (7%) percent. We accomplished this in just under two years, making it one of the fastest rates of inflation collapse recorded.\n",
      " Inflation in End-December 2022 was 6.9% percent, and the exchange rate between the Liberian dollar and the United States Dollar has remained stable within the range of 150 – 153 for the past twelve (12) months.\n",
      "\n",
      "We verify these statements in sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Macroeconomic Exception in the West African\n",
      "\n",
      "The Weah administration took office in 2018 following the end of the economist Ellen Johnson Sirleaf regime.\n",
      "Macroeconomics is the growth, inflation, employment, fiscal situation, and external debts.\n",
      "Growth rates differ considerably over time and across West African countries.\n",
      "The West Africa Economic Outlook 2019 states that Liberia and Sierra Leone recovered from the Ebola outbreak, which caused their economies to contract in 2014–16.\n",
      "“Since then, growth in Liberia has accelerated to 2.5 percent in 2017 and an estimated 3.2 percent in 2018. Sierra Leone has followed the same pattern, despite flooding in 2018. Growth rates in both countries are projected to return to pre-outbreak levels in 2019 and 2020.”\n",
      "The World Bank projected Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to slow from 4.1% in 2021 to 3.3% in 2022, owing to a slowdown in global growth, rising inflation exacerbated by the Ukraine war, adverse weather conditions, a tightening of global financial conditions, and an increase in the risk of debt distress.\n",
      "Though the Liberian economy recovered in 2021 from COVID-19, GDP is estimated to have recovered by 3.3% from a decline of 3.0% in 2020.\n",
      "Conclusion: According to the Macroeconomic performance and prospects 2019 report, Liberia had a floating or managed float system from 2008 and 2018.\n",
      "Furthermore, the IMF stated that, despite delays in the broad-based reform plan, Liberian authorities are continuing to implement prudent macroeconomic policies.\n",
      "“In general, the authorities kept the program on track by ensuring macroeconomic stability, a comfortable international reserve position, and debt sustainability.”\n",
      "There is no reason to believe Liberia is a West African macroeconomic outlier.\n",
      "2. INFLATION\n",
      "We have brought inflation down from a high of thirty (30%) percent to a single-digit rate that is now under seven (7%) percent. We accomplished this in just under two years, making it one of the fastest rates of inflation collapse in recorded economic history.\n",
      "2a. We have brought inflation down from a high of thirty (30%) percent to under seven (7%) percent. \n",
      "Before the election of President Weah, the inflation rate was 13.9 percent in January 2018, but it has since risen to 31.3 percent in August 2019.\n",
      "Then the Liberian Central Bank shifted from its former monetary policy framework to the current monetary targeting framework.\n",
      "Since its implementation, the present framework has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in combating inflation, as seen by a large drop in inflation from the high double digits to the single digits (from 30.55 percent in October 2019 to 5.46 percent in December 2021).\n",
      "Despite this gain, the domestic economy remains vulnerable to shocks that significantly influence the conduct of monetary policy, said in the West African Financial and Economic Review, June 2022 edition.\n",
      "In its country economic assessments for 2022, the IMF praised the Liberian government for its challenging and effective governance initiatives and policies that have maintained mainly macroeconomic stability.\n",
      "“Lowering inflation within single digits and maintaining a positive real GDP growth of 3.7% despite the enormous economic challenges facing the world at the time, such as COVID and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n",
      "The CBL Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI), a composite of the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), forecasts 6-9 percent inflation in 2022 from January to December.\n",
      "While the IMF places the Annual Percent Inflation rate, average consumer prices to 8.7 in 2022.\n",
      "On his social media page, former Minister of Finance Amara Konneh commended the government for improving the macroeconomic situation but said, “The government needs to do more to combat food inflation.”\n",
      "Conclusion: True, inflation has dropped to a single digit in the last two years, but given the disparities in percentages from the World Bank, CBL, and IMF, it is safe to say that even though inflation has dropped, we have yet to see inflation fall below 7%.\n",
      " 2b. fastest rates of inflation collapse in recorded economic history\n",
      "From 2020 to 2022, we compare inflation rates in Liberia 9.9 to neighboring countries such as Ghana, Cote D’ Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria.\n",
      "Countries202020212022Liberia27178.7Ghana9.91020.9Cote D’ Ivoire2.44.24Sierra Leone11.525.926.8Guinea12.612.712.2Nigeria1718.917.3Table of Neighboring Countries Inflation rates\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the World Bank, global headwinds are hurting Africa’s economic growth as countries grapple with growing prices, impeding progress toward poverty reduction.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the IMF said despite Liberia’s growth in 2022, the impending political cycle, which includes presidential and parliamentary elections in October  2023, is another source of concern.\n",
      "The international body recommends Liberia fully implement initiatives to enhance the business climate and increase credit availability, notably by expediting the resolution of non-performing loans. Improving educational attainment, tackling gender inequities, and adjusting to climate change is also crucial.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "There is no evidence that Liberia has seen the fastest rate of inflation drop in recorded economic history.\n",
      "3. Inflation at End-December 2022 was 6.9% percent\n",
      "False; according to the IMF for 2022, Liberia’s inflation rate is 8.7 percent, whereas AFDB puts it at 9.8 percent. Because the Liberia Financial Statistics (LFS) is a bi-monthly database published by the CBL, the CBL has not reported for December 2022.\n",
      "3a. The exchange rate between the Liberian dollar and the United States Dollar has remained stable within the range of 150 – 153 for the past twelve (12) months.\n",
      "No, the rate has been between 144.9386 – 157.94 for buying and selling, according to CBL.\n",

      "\n",
      "Screenshot from the World Health Organization dashboard capturing Ivory Coast gains in the COVID-19 fight\n",

      "In his sixth annual message to the legislature on January 30, President George Weah stated that the Liberia Land Rights Act is widely regarded as the most progressive pro-community land reform law on the African continent.\n",
      "Because it recognizes and protects customary land tenure and women’s land rights.\n",
      "” I applaud you for passage of the Land Rights Act and the Local Government Act in your first session in 2018.  The Land Rights Act has been considered by many as the most progressive pro-community land reform law on the African continent, as it recognizes and protects customary land tenure, as well as women’s rights to land.”\n",
      "President George Weah signed the Land Rights Act into law in September 2018, heralding it as a “landmark victory” by activists. \n",
      " In January 2018, Weah’s inauguration speech promised “clarity on fundamental matters such as the ground beneath their feet,” and many citizens felt a lengthy fight was coming to an end.\n",
      "The law applies to all land in Liberia, including private, public, government, and customary land.\n",
      "The Liberia Land Authority can enact the rules required to carry out this law.\n",
      "In Rwanda, the government passed a law in 1999 granting women equal inheritance rights to men, overturning previous beliefs that only male children may inherit. \n",
      "This has made it possible for widows and female orphans of the 1994 massacre to own land.\n",
      "According to the Kenyan Constitution (Republic of Kenya, 2010, article 61), the land is categorized into three categories. The Community Land Act 2016 (Republic of Kenya, 2016) establishes a new framework for identifying and registering customary holdings.\n",
      "The act states that any community may get a single collective title to its lands and control this property by established gender equity criteria.\n",
      "While Malawi has been engaging in a lengthy process of establishing new institutional frameworks for customary land administration. \n",
      "The Malawi National Land Policy (Government of the Republic of Malawi, 2002) sought to ensure that all Malawians had equal access to land. \n",
      "In 2016, this concept was formalized in ten law bills, including the Customary Land Act.\n",
      "This statute recognizes and allows for the registration of customary land in matrilineal or patrilineal societies.\n",
      "Because community-owned customary land can be titled and registered, it should protect against land grabs by local elites and foreigners.\n",
      "The tenure system for Senegalese land includes three overlapping legal systems: a customary system (derived from old customs), the registration system, and the French civil code system (as introduced by the colonial government). \n",
      "With Law 64-46, known as the national domain law, the Senegalese government attempted to integrate the three systems in 1964.\n",
      "Land was separated into three types under this land reform: state land, private land, and national land. \n",
      "State land (which comprised only 3% of Senegal’s land in 1964) is owned by the state and is divided into public and private land (the state can sell these private lands).\n",
      "Individuals with a land title own private land (which made up only 2% of Senegal’s land in 1964). \n",
      "Unlike land in the national domain, this land can be the subject of land transactions (sale, leasing, pledge, etc.).\n",
      "In nations with highly developed land markets, land ownership often indicates “full ownership,” which includes the whole set of rights owned by the landowner, including the right to transfer or dispose of (as in freehold) (e.g., Kenya and Malawi, with restrictions).\n",

      "Even before then, other variations of the claim have circulated. A search for “once every 823 years” revealed the claim is a mixture of several myths related to the calendar. \n",
      "\n",
      "The social media user said the four of each day are called ‘MiracleIn,’ a team which, according to a user from Georgia, U.S., means “Miracle or by the hand of God.”\n",
      "Users additionally requested that the above message be sent to at least five people or 5 Groups, and a miracle would happen within four days because unexplainable biblical miracles back it.\n",
      "Verification: February has 29 days in leap years, one more than usual. Leap years are caused by the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, which naturally takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. \n",
      "The extra hours after 365 days are compensated with an additional day in February every four years. \n",
      "The claim was fact-checked by Latestly and Vishvasnew\n",
      "For instance, the last leap year was 2020, when February had 29 days. Five of those days were Saturdays, while other days of the week occurred just four times each.\n",
      "The simple mathematics about this claim that can help you quickly understand is that February has 28 days, and when divided by seven, each week has four days; that is, four Mondays, four Tuesdays, four Wednesdays, four Thursdays, and four Fridays-(28÷7=4).\n",
      "This occurrence will repeatedly appear as years pass by and not after 823 years, as claimed.\n",
      "The coming years show that 2024 February, which will be a leap year, will not have 4 of each day, but 2025 and 2026 will have  4 Sundays, 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays, 4 Thursdays, 4 Fridays, and 4 Saturdays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: The claim is false: there is nothing special about February this year as claimed by the social media users; every day of the week appears four times – just as it does in all non-leap years.\n",

      "Source:  Drunk-News\n",
      "Full text: “ Social media blog named Drunk News on  December 21, 2022 posted that Information Minister Legerhood Rennie said that he can’tsee nor talk to the President, overall, no money to run his Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism ( MICAT).”\n",
      "The post made by Drunk-News attracted 206 likes, 93 comments, and 138 shares. \n",
      "Minister Ledgerhood Rennie was appointed on October 1, 2020, taking over from Lenn Eugene Nagbe, now Commissioner General of Liberia’s Maritime Authority. \n",
      "Recently, the Ministry has been criticized for failing to pay its workers after its former Minister Eugene Fahngon took to Facebook to say that it was paying as low as US$45.00 and witch-hunting workers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The workers protested at the Ministry in November of 2022 over  Salary Deductions.\n",
      "November 14, 2022, release said the protest action is not the making of the Ministry’s senior management team. \n",
      "It is instead the result of a long-standing salary disparity with MICAT’s Payroll.\n",
      "Did the Minister Say  No Money run  MICAT? \n",
      "When TSM contacted Minister Rennie via WhatsApp to verify, he termed the entire post rubbish. \n",
      "TSM also sent him a video, but Minister Rennie did not respond even though he read the message via WhatsApp.\n",
      "However, in the video of a live interview with the Minister on OK Morning Rush on December 21, 2022, Rennie was squarely heard complaining of the lack of support to run the affairs at the Minister of Information, Cultural Affairs, and Tourism. \n",
      "“We are struggling to carry out our mandate; it means that what we expect to have to be able to do what is expected of us has not been forthcoming.”\n",
      "He continues, ” just to be frank, some of the criticism that we get comes from the fact that we just do not  have it to do what is expected of us.”\n",
      "“The job is difficult now because of the lack of support,”\n",
      "“So it seems difficult from the outside, but it is not a difficult job when you have the support you need to get.”\n",
      "Minister Rennie furthered, “When you employ a coach, you give him the mandate to qualify a team for a particular tournament.”\n",
      "“Most times, people expect that I should be defending the government against things that have been said about the government; What the government is doing and how they are doing it, fair enough, but how do I do it; what is the budget that supports it?”\n",
      "Did the Minister Say He Couldn’t See or Talk to the President? \n",
      "The post by Drunk News of the Minister not seeing or talking with the President is partly true. The Minister did say in the interview, “I want to have a meeting with the president because I do not believe he is so aware of what is going on.”\n",
      "When quizzed by the interviewer that he should have unhindered access to the President, he said, “Yes, but we are in a political world, and certain things happened behind the scenes, so I do not want to talk about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: Following our investigations, the post by Drunk News is Partly True. The information about Minister Rennie saying he cannot see nor talk to the President is partly true. At the same time, the information about the Minister on the lack of funds to run MICAT is True.\n",

      "When President George Weah requested an extension of his trip to Paris, social media users and critics called him a liar and a criminal.\n",
      "“Why lie that the Paris forum was extended from November 18 and the official date was Nov 11-12? Shame on you, Jorweah. We will vote you out in 2023.\n",
      "According to the users, the Paris peace forum in France was never extended to November 18, as claimed by Liberia’s president George Weah. \n",
      "Hence, they claimed he (Weah) lied to the Liberian senate that the forum was extended from November 15-18, 2022.\n",
      "President George Weah’s communication to the Liberian senate, dated November 18, informed the August Body that the 5th Edition of the Paris Peace Forum had been extended to November 18.\n",
      "The big question here is, who is telling the truth? Did President George Weah attend the Paris Peace Forum in France on November 18 instead of the planned date of November 11 to 12?\n",
      "Research conducted by ‘The Stage Media’ proved that the conference was held from November 11-12 in the presence of France President Emmanuel Macron.\n",
      "This year’s Paris Peace Forum, the  5th Edition of the annual event, focuses on the theme ‘Riding out the Multi-crisis.’ The UNDP SDG Impact is among the 60 projects selected to be featured this year. \n",
      "The President did not lie about the extension of the Paris Peace Forum as speculated on social media.\n",
      "A stop followed the trip to Morocco in Egypt, where President Weah participated in the just-ended COP27, the United Nations Global Climate Change Conference, which kicked off on November 6, 2022, at the Tonino Lamborghini International Convention Center in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.\n",
      "This conference ran from November 6 to 8, 2022, when the Liberian President left for Qatar to join some world leaders for the official opening of the FIFA World Cup 2022.\n",
      "According to two separate communications sent to the Liberian Legislature, President Weah told the August body that his trip is intended to hold a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with his counterparts and business executives.\n",
      "He further revealed that the adjustment had necessitated his adjustment to attend the conference as a guest of honor to the official opening of the FIFA world cup in Qatar.\n",
      "President Weah Communication chief, Presidential Press Secretary Isaac Solo Kelgbeh, confirmed that the conference was held from November 11 to 12.\n",
      "He explained that the President requested an extension from the Liberian senate because his date schedule to meet with President Emmanuel Macron would have gone against his first communication sent to that august body.\n",
      "The Presidential Press Secretary added that the extension of time mentioned by the President in his communication included activities to the conference, as the President couldn’t have come back before going again to meet with his counterpart due to limited resources to sponsor such travel. \n",
      "The release also pointed out that the Paris Forum started on November 11 and climaxed on the 15th, but there were sideline meetings organized for heads of state to have met with president Emmanuel Macron.\n",
      "Conclusion:  following our interview with the presidential press secretary and the research conducted, the President of Liberia did not lie to the Liberian senate about the extension of his stay in France, but the request for an extension was to hold multi-bilateral talks with his counterparts and business executives.\n",

      "Source: Drunk-News\n",
      "Verdict: True; Minister Samuel Tweah said he did not see the amount he approved for President Weah’s recent trips.\n",
      "Full text: When Finance Minister Samuel Tweah appeared on Spoon FM, a widely monitored online TV and radio talk show, he told the hosts that he signed President George Weah’s cheque to travel but did not see how much was on it.\n",
      "The trip of Mr. Weah started on November 1, 2022, in Morocco, Egypt, where he addressed COP27 on November 9, 2022, and Qatar on November 18, 2022.\n",
      "The trip was extended to France and the United States, where he attended the Tuesday, December 13, 2022, second edition of the United States Africa Summit, dubbed the US-Africa Leaders’ Summit.\n",
      "How much is the President’s seven weeks’ budget out of the country? Tweah says he signed the cheque but didn’t see the amount.\n",
      "When Minister Tweah appeared on Spoon FM, the public had no idea of an extension of the President’s trip until a communication was sent to the Legislature requesting an additional 25 days.\n",
      "The post by Drunk-news attracted over 1.5k likes, 1.2k comments, and 81 shares.\n",
      "Verification:  Smith Toby is the Deputy Presidential Press Secretary. He says the President’s official delegation is 17 on both trips to Egypt (eight persons) and Qatar (nine persons).\n",
      " He says this excludes the advance team, which constitutes the President’s security and representatives from line ministries and agencies of government.\n",
      "TSM has listened to the live interview on spoon FM in which the Minister admitted to not seeing the amount on the cheque for the President’s trips even though he approved it.\n",
      "“I was out of the country and I did not see anything. My office staff sees the amount and does all of the paperwork, my job is to ensure where the President has to go, he goes,”\n",
      "Tweah continues, “There is a lot of paperwork, a lot of things and I am not going to be looking at all of that. The President has several lances on the trip.”\n",
      "“The President’s allowances are calculated in several different budgets to be sent at different times, and different levels of approval, because it has different lances, and I will have to do that math and see, so I wouldn’t be able to say the amount.”\n",
      "During the interview, Tweah further disclosed that President George Weah is “entitled” to a $2,000 (£1,700) daily allowance for his trip, which includes a stop in Qatar for nine days to watch the FIFA World Cup.\n",
      "Tweah cited the Liberia Foreign Travel Policy Manual No. 14: “The President as head of the delegation shall be given in addition to the entitled accommodation and per diem an Incidental Allowance of US$2,000.00 for each day of stay abroad for any extra accommodation charges and other incidental expense irrespective of the country he/she is traveling to. This amount shall be accounted for, including submission of the relevant hotel and other receipts on return.”\n",

      "He requests the ministry to publicize the President’s numerous trips, specifically budgetary allocations to those trips.\n",
      "Conclusion:  Research into the claim, based on the live interview with Spoon Fm and questions posed to Deputy Presidential Press Secretary Toby, The Stage Media concludes that Finance Minister Tweah did not give a projected amount of the President’s trip and at the same time, he said he did not see the amount in the cheque but approved it.\n",

      " VERDICT: Unconfirmed!\n",
      "The government of Liberia has said ‘it has no knowledge about “DEW” bottled water that has killed 180 persons in Tanzania to be currently on the local market.’\n",
      " FULL TEXT: “Hello, please pass this to any friends on your contact list – I just got this.

If you don’t believe it check google for ‘Dew bottled water. “Save lives as I just saved yours.” \n",
      " VERIFICATION: The message circulating on Whatsapp and Facebook that is warning consumers not to ‘buy or drink’ any bottled water called “DEW’ has been unconfirmed by the government of Liberia through the Ministries of Health and Commerce.\n",

      "President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would have implemented the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.\n",
      "President Weah did not tell UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.\n",
      "Full text\n",
      "Since the end of the 14 years of civil unrest, Liberians at home and abroad have been calling for establishing of a war and economic crimes court to prosecute the country’s perpetrators of war and financial crimes.\n",
      "The plea for justice is summed up in a story published in 2021.\n",
      "Even the now-ruling Coalition for Democratic Change led government, while in opposition, was the key champion for the country’s war and economic crimes court.\n",
      "The party held a series of protests demanding that the then-ruling Unity Party (UP) establish the court, a call that did not materialise.\n",
      "After winning power, the party made a profound u-turn, as seen here.\n",
      "Also, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established by the TRC Act in 2005 to “promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation.” \n",
      "It was also set-up to make it possible to hold perpetrators accountable for gross human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law that occurred in Liberia between January 1979 and October 2003.\n",
      "Since the end of the war, not a single Liberian has been prosecuted for their role in the war. Instead, some of the perpetrators are now being rewarded with top government positions such as senators and representatives, leaving their victims wallowing in economic deprivation. \n",
      "Appearing on a talk show, the Okay Conversation aired on Okay FM on Monday, October 24, 2022, the national youth chairman of the opposition ruling Unity Party, Melvin Cephas, stated that President George Weah told the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 that he would implement the War and Economic Crimes Court upon his return.\n",
      "Cephas further stated, “After telling the UNGA in 2019 that he would have implemented the war and economic crimes court, President Weah got back here and did nothing in that direction but only for him to return this year to tell some Liberians in the United States that Liberia looks like Miami.”\n",
      "The show, which was carried live on the station’s Facebook page, had about four hundred comments, over four thousand viewers and over one hundred and ninety emojis, and this statement is made at 2:23:1-18 seconds \n",
      "Verification\n",
      "Considering the importance of this claim and how sensitive it is for the people of Liberia, DUBAWA embarked on a fact-checking mission to investigate exactly what the Liberian leader told the UNGA in 2019.\n",
      "Through research, DUBAWA accessed the speech delivered by President George Weah at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019 and found as follows; the nine-page statement covered a variety of issues including the global crisis, poverty eradication, and quality education.\n",
      "However, pages five to seven focused largely on the war crimes and how the Liberia people have dealt or intend to deal with it. \n",
      "“When I spoke before you last September, after my first 9 months in office, I indicated a preference for dialogue as a conflict-resolution mechanism, so that as a Government and People, we could together focus our efforts on poverty-reduction, growth, and economic development, rather than on retribution. \n",
      "“However, since that time, there has been a rising chorus of voices from many quarters calling for the establishment of an economic and war crimes court. These voices include thousands of war victims and some of the alleged perpetrators, who seem to wish to either clear their names or their conscience. \n",
      "“Support for the establishment of the court has also been voiced by many international organizations, as well as some of our international partners. \n",
      "“Mr. President, we are at a loss to understand why the clamor for the establishment of the court is now being made, almost a full decade after it was first called for, and during which time no such pressure was brought to bear on the government that grew out of the Accra Peace Accord,” the president stated.\n",
      "“Considering the importance of this matter, I have already begun consultations with our National Legislature – the representatives of our people – and we intend to have a broader engagement with the Liberia Judicial System and with our strategic International Partners and Organisations to determine pertinent issues such as legal framework, timing, venue, and funding, among others,” he added. \n",
      "DUBAWA read the speech delivered by the president at the UNGA and found no promise to implement a war and economic crimes court.\n",
      "DUBAWA also watched the entire address by President George Weah during the UNGA 2019 presentation to be sure that what was in the script was exactly what was read by the president. From 10:49-16:19 portion of the video, the Liberian leader spoke about ways to bring lasting peace and stability to Liberia, just as in the script. \n",
      "At no point did he promise to implement war and economic crimes court.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Even though President George Weah spoke about the adverse impact of war crimes on the people of Liberia during his UNGA speech, he did not promise to implement the war and economic crimes court for Liberia.\n",

      "\n",
      "Claim: Public sector wage bill size was increased to 70% of the country’s expenditure totaling $320 million under Johnson Sirleaf.\n",
      "False! The last employee compensation under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was 59%, not 70% of expenditure. Data from the 2017 to 2018 budget statement and a report from USAID nullify the claim.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "A known supporter of the Weah-lead administration has said the erstwhile government under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf left behind an unsustainable wage bill. \n",
      "According to Samuel Jackson, an Economist, the wage bill under the former administration ballooned to 70%, amounting to $320 million. He said this left the government with little or no space for capital investment, which was essential in building post-war Liberia. \n",
      "He made the claim during a debate with Amos Tweh, Secretary General of the immediate past administration, the Unity Party.\n",
      "The debate was held on a local radio station, Okay FM 99.5, and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page on September 19, 2022. \n",
      "The claim by Mr Jackson was made at two hours and five minutes of the almost three-hour show.\n",
      "According to Jackson, due to this huge wage bill inherited by the CDC-led government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) requested the Weah-led government reduce the country’s wage bill. He said this led to the government harmonization plan during the first two years of the Weah administration.\n",
      "This action by the government led to a series of protests by some civil servants in the country.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "The IMF defines the wage bill “as the total compensation, in cash or kind, payable to a government employee in return for work. It includes wages and salaries, allowances, and social security contributions made on behalf of employees to social insurance schemes (IMF, 2014b).”\n",
      "According to the IMF working paper titled: Fiscal Implications of Government Wage Bill Spending, the higher the wage bill, especially in developing countries, the greater the fiscal imbalances.\n",
      "With this in mind and the huge public interest this debate has generated, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Mr Jackson.\n",
      "During the research, DUBAWA discovered that the last approved national budget of the country under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 2017/2018 puts the size of the country’s wage bill at 59% of total expenditure, amounting to $298.020,404 million. This is found on page xiii (3) of the 2017/2018 approved national budget of Liberia.\n",
      "Again, page two of the USAID report: Process mapping study, pay and payroll reform in the government of Liberia also confirms that the wage bill for the 2017-18 financial year was 57% of the Government of Liberia’s total expenditure. This is found under the caption ‘Fiscal Conditions.’ \n",
      "Conclusion    \n",
      "Following an investigation into the claim, DUBAWA can conclude, based on official documents available, that Liberia’s wage bill in the final year of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s administration was not 70%. It was 59%, according to the budget statement of 2017-18.\n",

      "Four years after United Nations (UN) peacekeepers officially left Liberia in 2018, debate still continues in the country over the legacy of the mission. \n",

      "After its creation peacekeeping authority passed from West African-led efforts.\n",
      "In a September 2022 interview on private Liberian radio station OK FM, prominent economist Samuel Jackson made two claims about peacekeeping in the country. \n",
      "“In 2018 Liberia was not a utopia. Liberia was coming out of the largest peacekeeping operation in Africa in the history of the UN – 17,000 peacekeepers,” he said. (Note: The claim can be heard at 1:43 minutes in the video.)\n",
      "Jackson, who was debating Amos Tweh, the secretary general of the Unity Party, was tracing some of Liberia’s modern-day struggles to the departure of the mission, and the financial hit the economy took. \n",

      "“Unmil was never the largest UN mission,” Novosseloff confirmed to us. She said the ones in the DRC and Darfur were larger.\n",
      "Dr. Lise Morjé Howard, a senior scholar-in-residence at the US Congress-backed Institute of Peace, said: “No, Unmil was not the largest mission. Generally only ‘blue helmets’ count as peacekeepers.”\n",

      "Was Liberia’s mission a success?\n",
      "The legacy of the peacekeeping mission in Liberia continues to be debated. Some have highlighted the economic shock to the country following the mission’s exit.\n",
      "Dr Lise Morjé Howard of the Institute of Peace told The Stage Media that the Liberia peacekeeping mission was considered successful because the UN implemented most parts of its mandate before departing. \n",
      "Numbers aside, the mission was not very different from other peacekeeping operations once Liberia decided it was in its best interest to cooperate with the UN mission, Alexandra Novosseloff of the International Peace Institute said.\n",
      "“What worked in that process [was] that there was a high-level committee where the UN, the European Commission and major embassies were meeting to coordinate their policies, views and actions.”\n",
      "In a September 2021 webinar for the Institut Barcelona D’Estudis Internacionals, a Spanish inter-university institute, Robert Blair said the Liberia mission had increased citizens’ reliance on state authorities and also exacerbated the perception of state corruption in the country.\n",
      "He wrote the book Peacekeeping and the Rule of Law after the Civil War.\n",
      "“The UN has positive and potentially lasting effects on the rule of law in war-torn countries like Liberia and the goal of a UN mission should not be transforming a country to look like Sweden but to improve the quality of lives and governance.” We have contacted Blair for more comments.\n",
      "Conclusion: Other African UN peacekeeping missions are larger, but Liberia’s legacy still debated\n",
      "In a debate on the radio, Liberian economist Samuel Jackson claimed the UN’s Liberia mission had been the largest in Africa, with 17,000 troops. \n",
      "But publicly available data shows there have been other UN missions on the continent with considerably more military personnel, including in Sudan and the DRC. At its height, the Liberia mission had 15,000 uniformed personnel. \n",
      "Both parts of the claim are therefore inaccurate. The legacy of the mission however continues to be avidly debated.\n",
      "This report by The Stage Media Liberia was written as part of the 2022 Africa Check fellowship programme. The programme is one of many ways in which Africa Check fosters the practice of fact-checking across the continent.\n",

      "What was meant to be a peaceful demonstration on Liberia’s 175th Independence Day celebration turned violent after a pro-government group, the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) Council of Patriots (COP), brutalized a student of the state-run campus-based political party, The Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP).\n",
      "The incident occurred early on Tuesday, July 26, 2022, after the students decided to stage a protest before the United States Embassy in Monrovia. Among other things, the students asked the government to fix the country, a tagline that has become popular for many anti-government protesters.\n",
      "The violence is a drawback for the country’s fledgling democracy, something DUBAWA is concerned about and has taken an interest in understanding vis-a-vis causes of the violence, the groups associated with it, and what can be done to avoid such violence in the future.\n",
      "The Coalition and Patriots Marriage \n",
      "The Coalition for Democratic Change Council of Patriots (CDC CoP) is a breakaway group from what used to be the Council of Patriots, an anti-government organization that was vehement in its opposition to the ruling government. Since breaking away and joining forces with the governing party, it has spared no effort backing all government projects and activities.\n",
      "The violence witnessed on July 26 appears to be a by-product of this new political marriage in which the breakaway members of the Council Patriots underlined their steadfast allegiance to the Coalition of Democratic Change. In the process, some members of The Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP) became victims of the violent attacks.\n",
      "Demonstration and political violence\n",
      "The members of Vanguard Student Unification Party (SUP) were angry over what they said was the rising cost of living in Liberia, the rising state of insecurity, and a weak educational system.\n",
      "Food prices have soared, owing largely to hikes in gasoline, which is now selling at US$5.66 (L$875), up from US$5.00 (L$750). As a result, transportation fares have increased, thus triggering agitations by some commercial drivers, bike and tricycle (Kehkeh) riders, and other citizens in the country. \n",
      "There have also been a series of deaths in the country, raising questions about insecurity. In a recent conversation, it was so severe that the President charged Liberians to install CCTV for their protection. The Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nathaniel McGill, was also on record saying that the government is considering making the installation of CCTV mandatory in the country, as reported by the government-owned news outlet, The Liberia News Agency (LINA).\n",
      "These comments angered a section of the citizens, including members of the SUP. They were also not happy with the results of Liberian students in the WASSCE exams, even though the Weah administration shouldered the cost of taking the West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE) for all senior students in the country.\n",
      "For these reasons and many others, the protestors first hit the streets on July 26, first to the US Embassy in Liberia to hand over their petition. \n",
      "Why the US Embassy?\n",
      "Per Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, Heads of Missions have a duty not to interfere with the internal activities of a host country. However, in Liberia, the angry protesters say they had lost confidence in the Weah-led administration so much that they did not even trust him to listen to their grievances. Instead, they believed the US Embassy could engage the Weah administration better, hence their decision to petition the US Embassy.\n",
      "On the day of the demonstration, the students who had decided to converge on campus before making their way to the US Embassy in Monrovia changed their plan by moving straight to the Embassy. \n",
      "At the US Embassy, located at the top of Benson Street in central Monrovia, the students waved placards with inscriptions “fix the country” while chanting anti-government slogans. This did not go well with the Coalition of Democratic Change Council of Patriots (CDC CoP), who embarked on a counter-protest.\n",
      "Checks by DUBAWA  indicate that as early as 6:00 am that fateful Tuesday morning, the CDC-CoP, besieged the headquarters of the campus-based political party, SUP, on the Capitol Hill campus of the University of Liberia, hoping to find the students there. Seeing nobody, the CDC-CoP members moved to the US Embassy wearing white t-shirts with the words, “George Weah is fixing the country. \n",
      "There was chaos shortly after, with the pro-government supporters chasing and pelting the anti-government supporters with stones. This would later turn bloody with injuries to several students, one of them critical. The victim, Christopher Walter Sisulu Sivili, was brutalized in the full glare of the camera. He was hospitalized in Liberia for some days but has since been flown out of the country to seek medical attention.\n",
      "This attack has received widespread condemnation by multiple stakeholders in Liberia. \n",
      "The Minister of Justice, Musa F Dean, has condemned the violent acts. He did not receive any request from any group for a demonstration, as required by law. Per Liberia’s Public Order Law which is the National Police Act 2015 Section III Article 22.86, persons who wish to embark on any demonstration must first petition the Minister of Justice.\n",
      "He has since directed the Inspector General of Police to investigate the attacks.\n",
      "The lawsuit against aggressors?\n",
      "Even before the IGP began investigations into the matter, the Council of Patriots (CoP) had sworn to take legal action against the group that attacked the SUP.\n",
      "Joseph Vallai, COP Secretary General \n",
      "The Secretary General of the group, Joseph K. Vallai, disclosed that the organization would institute a 1.5million lawsuit against the abusers of the victim to ensure that he gets justice.\n",
      "“What happened on July 26 of this year was a complete crackdown on civil liberty and abuse of human rights in public square and this cannot be a CDC-CoP thing, because was an attack on post war Liberia’s democracy,” he noted.\n",
      "Explaining why some members broke away from the group, Mr. Vallai stated the aggrieved persons were suspended for acts of insubordination. For that reason, they decided to join the governing party. \n",
      "He said the Council of Patriots was established to hold the Weah administration accountable to the people and will need committed members to do that. \n",
      "Since its formation in 2019, the group has had a series of protests in the country, including the famous June 7, 2019 protest under the theme: “Save the State.” It is regarded as Liberia’s biggest post-war protest. \n",
      "Student Unification Party (SUP)\n",
      "Members of the SUP\n",
      "DUBAWA contacted the General Secretary of the Student Unification Party (SUP), Jusu Kamara, to find out his thoughts about the demonstration and the attacks.\n",
      "“We were calling on the George Weah administration to fix the educational sector of this country and the kangaroo justice system. We were also calling on him to act on the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) reports which fingered several government officials and institutions, including the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) for acts of corruption,” he stated. \n",
      "Kamara condemned the attack on the students during their demonstration. Meanwhile, the campus-based political party has vowed to come out in their numbers to stage another protest until the George Weah-led government listens to their calls.  \n",
      "Coalition of Democratic Change (CDC) Council of Patriots (CoP)\n",
      "On their part, though, members of the Coalition for Democratic Change have dismissed the allegations of violence against them. According to the group’s chairman, Ben Believe Togbah Jnr, they did not organize any violent protest as was reported. Speaking on OKAY FM, which was transmitted live on the station’s official Facebook Page, Mr. Togbah Jnr denied accusations of counter-demonstration and violent attacks on the SUP. \n",
      "Members of the CDC-CoP\n",
      "According to him, they had gone to show gratitude to President Weah for the many developmental initiatives undertaken since becoming President. Still, they encountered hostile members of the Student Unification Party (SUP), some of whom were throwing rocks and wielding deadly weapons, an allegation that DUBAWA cannot independently verify.\n",
      "What does Civil Society think About Demonstrations?\n",
      "The Executive Director of the Center For Media Studies & Peace Building (CEMESP), Malcolm W. Joseph, has condemned the violent demonstrations. He told DUBAWA that Article 17 of the Liberian constitution spells out the right for every Liberian to assemble at all times freely but in an orderly manner.\n",
      "He is convinced that notifying the government before a demonstration is necessary to ensure the safety of the demonstrators but was quick to throw in a word of caution.\n",
      "“Notifying the government does not mean that the government will have to be selective in who demonstrates or who doesn’t. Sometimes when the government of the day realizes that those who want to protest or demonstrate are critical of the government, the government may not want to grant them the permission to do so,” he stated\n",

      "Claim: Persons with Dual Citizenship under the new dual citizenship law of Liberia are allowed to contest for Representatives and Senators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere in the new law does it allow dual citizens to be elected as Representatives, and Senators.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "Liberia was founded by freed US slaves in 1847 as “a refuge and a haven for freed men of colour”. Its constitution defines black people in the language of the time, as “persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent”.\n",
      "For years, the issue of dual citizenship in Liberia has been a very critical topic in the country since its post-war era. This is so because, during the country’s over fourteen years of civil unrest, many Liberians fled the country for safety in other countries, particularly in Europe and the Americas and took up those countries’ citizenship for diverse reasons.\n",
      "The old alien and Nationality law states “A child who is a Liberia citizen by virtue of the provisions of subparagraph (b) of this section shall lose his citizenship unless he has resided in Liberia before attaining his majority or unless when he attains his majority and before attaining the age of 23 he goes before a Liberian consul and takes the oath of allegiance to the Republic of Liberia required of a petitioner for naturalization.”\n",
      "This law states further “(a) A person who is a Negro, or of Negro descent, born in Liberia and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. (b) A person born outside Liberia whose father (i) was born a citizen of Liberia; (ii) was a citizen of Liberia at the time of the birth of such child, and (iii) had resided in Liberia prior to the birth of such child.”\n",
      "Upon taking over as President of Liberia in 2018, President George Manneh Weah asserted during his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) that the Liberian constitution was racist, unnecessary and inappropriate and promised to scrap the law that prohibits foreigners from becoming citizens of the country.\n",
      "His position was further strengthened by a landmark case in 2019 when the Liberian Supreme Court ruled that citizenship is a right that could not be revoked without a trial. However, it is believed that some Liberians, especially the privileged, secretly carry dual passports.\n",
      "Notwithstanding how crucial this case was, it did not automatically grant Liberians a right to be dual citizens.\n",
      "There was a continued push for the new law on dual citizens with Liberians in the diaspora playing a huge role. After years of controversy including a referendum to reject the Dual Citizens law in December 2020, the country has finally agreed to a new Dual Citizens law passed in 2022.\n",
      "There is, however, some simmering controversy over the rights to be accorded the dual citizens of Liberia.During a radio talk show aired on a local radio station, Okay 99.5FM, Wednesday, August 10, 2022, Montserrado County District #16 Representative Dixon Seboe claimed that under the new amended alien and nationality law of Liberia, persons with dual citizenship are allowed to contest for Representatives and senators but cannot be speaker of the House of Representatives and President Pro-Tempore of the Liberian Senate.\n",
      "The claim was made in the 14 minute of the show and was carried live on the station’s Facebook page with over two thousand viewers and more than one hundred and fifty comments. This show is one of the most widely listened to shows in the country.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "Given how controversial this case has been over decades and the premium attention it has garnered owing to the amendment of the law, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe.\n",
      "This Fact Checker combed through the provisions of the old law which the amendment sought to change. The old laws include Part III, Chapter 20, Section 20.1; Chapter 21, Sections 21.30, 21.31, 21.51 & 21.52 and Chapter 22, Sections 22.1, 22.1 & 22.4 of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Liberian Code of Law Revised, Vol. II.\n",
      "DUBAWA then went further to look at the new amendment passed by Parliament to ascertain if the claim by the Representative was true.\n",
      "Part of the new amendment can be accessed in this news report with the relevant portions of the new law quoted as follows;\n",
      "“A Liberian citizen who holds citizenship for another country shall not be eligible for any elective public office while still a citizen of another country,” the legislature said in the repeal of the Aliens and Nationality Law.\n",
      "“If such a person desires to contest, the person must renounce the citizenship of the other country at least one year before applying to the National Elections Commission (NEC) to contest with documentary evidence of such renunciation from the country and filed with a circuit court in Liberia.”\n",
      "“Also, a Liberian citizen who holds the citizenship of another country must not be eligible for appointment to the public offices of Minister of Finance and Development Planning; Minister of Defense, and Executive Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia.”\n",
      "As can be seen, the amended law prohibits those with dual citizenship from occupying an elected office and from becoming Minister of Defense, Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia and Minister of Finance in the country.\n",
      "The new law has received massive media reviews and reportage as can be seen here and here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Checks by DUBAWA into the amended law do not support the claim made by Representative Dixon Seboe. While the amended law grants Liberians power to hold dual citizenship it does not allow dual citizens to occupy elected office and other sensitive positions.\n",

      "Claim: “The government through the Central Bank of (CBL) has minted coins in the L$25 and L$30 denominations,” according to a Facebook user.\n",
      "Verdict: The Central Bank of Liberia says it only minting coins in L$5 and L$10 denominations.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "Liberia seems to be returning to the pre-war era where Liberians used coins for business transactions and as legal tender. In 1847 and 1862, copper 1 and 2 cents coins were issued and were the only Liberian coins until 1896, when a full coinage consisting of 1, 2, 10, 25 and 50 cents coins were introduced. The last issues were made in 1906.\n",
      "In accordance with Article 34(d) of the Liberian constitution, the Liberian legislature mandated the Central Bank of Liberia to print new currency and mint coins in the country.\n",
      "Article 34(d) states that the legislature shall have the power, among other things, “to levy taxes, duties, imports, exercise and other revenues, to borrow money, issue currency, mint coins, and to make appropriations for the fiscal governance of the Republic.” \n",
      "It is upon this reliance, the Liberian legislature, on May 6, 2021, signed and issued a joint resolution (Resolution #001/2021) authorizing the Central Bank of Liberia to print and mint the new family of Liberian currency to the tone of L$48 billion \n",
      "The legislature’s decision was informed by the Counsel from the Economic Management Team (EMT) of the country falling shortages of Liberian dollar notes on the market. There is also a huge quantity of mutilated banknotes and the scarcity of smaller denominations like L$5, L$10 and L$20 Liberian banknotes on the market. \n",
      "This new currency is expected to be printed and minted within a three-year period beginning in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The year  2023 was skipped because, according to the legislature, it is the election year.\n",
      "There have been occasions where taxi drivers, tricycles (kehkeh), and motorbike riders and passengers get into confrontations over lack of change or when there is disagreement over mutilated currency as change or transport fares.   \n",
      "It is to solve these challenges that the Liberia Legislature in March of 2021, granted authorization to the CBL for the printing and minting of new family of Liberian currency. \n",
      "Following the authorization, the CBL, in December of 2021 printed and brought into the country the first consignment of newly printed Liberian dollar banknotes so as to help ease the problems during the festive season CBL. \n",
      "Despite the coming of the first batch of the newly printed Liberian dollars in the country, the problem of shortages of smaller denominations and mutilated money still persisted because the CBL had only printed notes in higher denominations, including one hundred Liberian dollars here CBL.\n",
      "Despite the chronology of the events, there has been news of the arrival of the new family of banknotes and minted coins in the country with some Liberians taking to their social media (Facebook) pages with claims of what they believe is the image of the newly minted coins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Among the many posts on social media (Facebook) was  Liberia’s famous social media giant based in Canada, Varney A Teah who goes by the Facebook name “Strong Gbana Pekin.” \n",
      "This post by Strong Gbana Pekin generated over 250 comments, 13 shares and over 270 emojis.\n",

      "Due to the seriousness of the currency situation in the country, DUBAWA embarked on an investigative venture to ascertain the facts surrounding the various posts flooding social media (Facebook) in recent times as can be seen here and here.\n",
      "DUBAWA first decided to look at the authorization granted the CBL to print banknotes and mint coins, by the Liberian Legislature “Resolution #001/2021” and resolution is found on page 18 and 19 of the CBL annual report 2021.\n",
      "DUBAWA went further by contacting one of the officials at the CBL Atty. Alphonso Zeon to provide explanation for the various claims on Facebook about the new 30 Liberian dollars and 25 Liberian dollars minted coins.\n",
      "Mr. Alponson Zeon insisted there were no 30 or 25 Liberian dollar minted coins as can be seen in the WhatsApp conversation below. \n",
      "\n",
      "DUBAWA also contacted the Head of Communication at the CBL, Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio, who told us that the various claims on Facebook are false.\n",
      "Mr. Cyrus Wleh Badio indicated that the news trending on Facebook about the bank minting 25 and 30 Liberian dollars coins are fabricated and far from the truth as can be seen again in the WhatsApp conversation below.\n",
      "\n",
      "A release has, however, been issued by the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs & Tourism (MICAT) clarifying the numerous Facebook posts. \n",
      "\n",
      "This statement was also published on the government-run media outlet, The New Liber Newspaper as well as on Liberia Ministry of Information Facebook page.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Investigation by DUBAWA into social media (Facebook) posts suggests that speculations that the CBL has minted L$25 and L$30 coins are false. The CBL has clarified that it has only minted L$5 and L$10 in coins contrary to the many Facebook posts. \n",

      "Claim: UBA Ghana Reportedly Blocked Nathaniel McGill’s $4M Account\n",
      "Verdict: False\n",
      "Full Text: Global News Network, Thursday, August 18, reported that Suspended Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Nathaniel McGill’s account at United Bank for Africa (UBA) in Accra, Ghana, containing over Four Million United States Dollars, has been blocked based on instructions from the sanctions committee.\n",
      "The story attracted many social media users, including KMTV, an online media outlet, and blogs: All Factz, and  The Liberian Influence.\n",
      "Monday, August 15, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had designated three Liberian government officials, Nathaniel McGill, Sayma Syrenius Cephus, and Bill Twehway, for their involvement in ongoing public corruption in Liberia.\n",
      "According to the notice, these officials were designated under Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of severe human rights abuse and corruption around the world.\n",
      "“Through their corruption, these officials have undermined democracy in Liberia for their own personal benefit,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Treasury’s designations today demonstrate that the United States remains committed to holding corrupt actors accountable and to the continued support of the Liberian people,” the Department said.\n",
      "The U.S. government is accusing McGill of bribing business owners, receiving bribes from potential investors, and accepting kickbacks for steering contracts to companies in which he is interested.\n",
      "He is also said to have manipulated public procurement processes to award multi-million dollar contracts to companies in which he has ownership, including by abusing emergency procurement processes to rig contract bids.\n",
      "“McGill is credibly accused of involvement in a wide range of other corrupt schemes including soliciting bribes from government office seekers and misappropriating government assets for his gain. He has used government funds allocated to other Liberian government institutions to run his projects, made off-the-books payments in cash to senior government leaders, and organized warlords to threaten political rivals. \n",
      "McGill has received an unjustified stipend from various Liberian government institutions and used his position to prevent his misappropriation from being discovered. McGill regularly distributes thousands of dollars in undocumented cash to other government officials for government and non-government activities.\n",
      "McGill is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery,” the U.S. authorities said.\n",
      "The U.S. authorities have therefore ordered that all property and interests in property of these politicians that are in the United States or the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC.\n",
      "Verification: The Stage Media contacted UBA Ghana through its Facebook page, and the bank said, “Please be informed that we do not have an account in UBA Ghana in the name of Nathaniel  McGill. Therefore, we can’t block a statement we do not have. The reports are false and should be disregarded.\n",
      "We also used ScamDoc to verify the Facebook Page of the bank, which analysis resulted in a 99 percent trusted source.\n",
      "Ghana Business News also reported that “UBA Ghana says there’s no $4m account in the name of a Liberian government official on U.S. sanctions list.”\n",
      "In the article, the Ghana news outlet said Henry Nii Dottey, Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications of the bank, in an inquiry on the claim, said on August 19, 2022, that the bank has no account in the name of McGill.\n",
      "Furthermore, McGill told FrontPage Africa that he does not have Foreign accounts.\n",
      "“I am one official of the government who does not have any foreign bank account. GAC or whoever can audit me, I don’t have any foreign account, and neither am I a signatory to the Ministry of State’s account. I don’t take government money,” Min. McGill told FPA.\n",
      "Conclusion: With UBA Ghana verifying the claim, it is safe to say that the story reported by Global News Network is False.\n",

      "Verdict: Uncheckable   \n",
      "Full Text: several claims on social media users says the United States government has declared Mrs. Dialokai Kemayah, wife of Foreign Minister Maxwell Kemayah, a persona non grata. \n",
      "She served as the Minister’s Counselor at the Liberian Mission in New York. \n",
      "The claim further that Madam Kemayah was ordered to leave the United States immediately.\n",
      "“persona non grata” indicates that a diplomatic agent of a state is unacceptable to the receiving state. This can take place either before the individual is accredited, indicating that the proposed appointee is unacceptable to the host state and will not be received, or after the accreditation process in response to some real or alleged impropriety by the diplomatic agent.\n",
      "“Proclaiming a diplomat persona non grata usually results from an unfriendly attitude toward the (prospective) receiving state, violation of its laws or of international law, or improper diplomatic behavior or indiscretions, although the host state may proclaim a diplomat persona non grata for any or no reason. The sending state must then recall its agent or, should not recall occurring, the host state may ignore the presence of the diplomatic agent or expel the diplomat from its territory.”\n",
      "Verification: Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah, Minister of Foreign Affairs, during his appearance before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs to discuss Liberia’s foreign issue on June 28, 2022, disclosed that his wife, Dialokai Golayon-Kemayah was never declared a persona non-grata by the United States government when serving as Liberia’s Consulate General to New York.\n",
      "Kemayah’s response came shortly after Montserrado County Senator, Abraham Darius Dillon questioned him about the status of his wife as head of Liberia’s diplomatic mission in New York.\n",
      "“In forging service or diplomatic professions, we refer to it as a nomadic profession you can pick up your things today and go, and tomorrow they ask you to come back; we called that recalled. A recall is very normal everywhere.\n",
      "The minister Consulate was recalled by the Liberian government,” Kemayah said.\n",
      "Dillon asked the Minister saying, “Mr. Minister, let me remind you that you are under oath, was the Minister Consulate  recalled by President Weah or removed from America by the State Department and declare personal non-grata?”\n",
      "Kemayah replied promptly, “The government of Liberia recalled the Minister Consulate since I began as Minister of Foreign Affairs, no diplomat has been declared as persona non-grata by any of host governments.”\n",
      "A spokesperson of the U.S Embassy near Monrovia when contacted, told The Stage Media, “Thanks for reaching out to us and we apologize if we are late in responding to your inquiry we cannot comment on individual immigration matters or concerns. We recommend you reach out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the individuals in question.”\n",

It is very scary and serious. In fact, according to my research, most airports in the world especially in West Africa, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone all have private airports and they run efficiently; the government has a share ranging from 10-25%’’\n",

      "Airline authorities and workers have also been protesting the situation by either canceling or scaling down their flights.\n",
      "Verification: In Ghana, the Kotoka International Airport is operated by Ghana Airports Company Limited, which has its offices on the airport property. It is the sole international airport in Ghana.\n",
      "It was registered in 2006 and presently manages airports such as Kotoka International Airport, Wa Airport, Tamale Airport, Sunyani Airport, Ho Airport, Kumasi Airport, and other airstrips in Ghana. It was established as a result of the decoupling of the existing Ghana Civil Aviation Authority(GCAA) which was in line with current trends that are in the aviation industry.\n",
      "Though, in 2019, there was a claim that the airport was to be privatized but the claim was dismissed by Ghana’s Aviation Minister.\n",
      "While in Sierra Leone Freetown International Airport in Lungi is Sierra Leone’s main airport.  The airport is operated by the Sierra Leone Airports Authority. Before its use as a civilian airport, it was a British Royal Air Force base.

      " \n",

      "Source: President George Manneh Weah\n",
      " \n",
      "Verdict: False\n",
      " \n",
      "Full Text: President George Manneh Weah in the State of the Nation Address (SONA) claimed that the Atlantic Cocoa Corporation exported for the first time in Liberia containers of certified organic cocoa from Liberia.\n",
      " \n",
      "“ While Liberia’s cocoa production lags behind production giants in the region, Liberian cocoa continues to win awards and prizes in international competitions for its exceptional quality. My administration is therefore promoting and working to provide the enabling environment for high-quality production of cash and food crops.\n",
      " \n",
      "Verification: In Liberia, cocoa is an important cash crop whose export potential remains dormant as a result of 14 years of civil conflict that plagued the country from 1989 to 2003 and the slow, albeit growing, support the sector has received since the end of the conflict. \n",
      " \n",
      "The cocoa output that stood at 10,000 tons per year in the 1970s dropped to near-zero levels for the duration of the conflict.\n",
      " \n",
      "A Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) survey published in 2002 noted that the number of cocoa farms operating in 2001 had dropped to 38% of the pre-war level (1988), indicating the widespread impact.\n",
      "On the side of the market, Liberia faces an uphill battle as it seeks to position itself with strong regional competitors such as Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the former with a global reputation for supply capacity and consistency and the latter with a worldwide reputation for supplying high-quality cocoa. \n",
      " \n",
      "There is significant progress to be made in terms of building a global brand for Liberian cocoa that not only builds upon high levels of supply consistency and quality but is also identified through a brand of its own in international target markets.\n",
      "The Stage Media in verifying the claims reached out to Sheikh Turay, CEO of Liberation Cocoa, who did not agree with the information.\n",
      " \n",
      "He said exporting organic cocoa is the new trend for cocoa dealers adding that in time past, exports were just cocoa beans.\n",
      " \n",
      "He named African Venture Liberia as the institution that exported cocoa in 2018.\n",
      " \n",
      "Also, a former employee Siehdi, of the company posted on her social media page on January 24 that the claim was untrue.\n",
      " \n",
      "“The FIRST CONTAINERS OF CERTIFIED COCOA amounting to 82 tons exported from Liberia in 2018 was being sold by Africa Ventures Limited (AVL) owned by Mr. George Howard who was a beneficiary of a project.”\n",
      "“I worked on as an Intervention Manager. I spent months, weeks, days on the roads from Monrovia to Buu-Yao District, Nimba County. I can name every town that was part of that success story. \n",
      "LACRA and MOA have that information and I do too. Atlantic is not the first to export certified cocoa. #SONA\n",
      "According to her, the African Venture Liberia was been certified by UTZ now Rainforest Alliance.\n",
      " \n",
      "Additionally,  the Liberia National Cocoa Strategy 2014-2018 states that the figures of sustainable production stand in stark contrast to the overall supply of conventional cocoa on the global market, of which 70% is produced in Africa\n",
      " \n",
      "Both Rainforest Alliance and organic cocoa have driven this trend with 76.2% and 75.7%, respectively, of their total supply provided by Latin America. \n",
      " \n",
      "It furthers that Fairtrade represents the exception to this rule, being predominantly supplied by African producers. \n",
      " \n",
      "The trend for sourcing is likely to change, not only as the field for certified cocoa is fairly new, but also as West African producers start to certify their production. Organic cocoa is the only sustainable cocoa with sourcing (4.9%) from Asia.\n",
      " \n",
      "Meanwhile, TSM  contacted Gordon Garway, Communication Director, Liberia Agriculture Commodity Regulatory Authority (LACRA).\n",
      " \n",
      "According to him, the information was given included in SONA22 because the entity recorded current events under the institution.\n",
      " \n",
      "“We do not have a record of what occurred before the establishment of LACRA, so we recorded what exactly occurred since we started operation.”\n",
      " \n",
      "LACRA was established to replace the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation (LPMC) as defined in Chapter 57 of the Executive Law of 1973 for promoting the production, processing and marketing of high-quality agricultural commodities particularly cocoa, coffee, palm other agricultural produce.\n",
      " \n",
      "The entity is to ensure the provision of a well-regulated market for cocoa, coffee, palm and other agricultural products for fair competition among all actors in the value chain; facilitate standardization of quality of agricultural commodities including cocoa, coffee, palm etc.\n",
      " \n",
      "Conclusion: President Weah’s claim that ACC is the first to export organic cocoa is False; moreover, LACRA replaced LPMC; therefore, the SONA22 on Cocoa export is incorrect.\n",

      "What Happened next?\n",
      "The discussion with the Kuwait Fund focused on the allocation of US$1.8 million provided to the government for the feasibility study for the Gbarnga-Mendekoma Highway, and on funding opportunities for the construction of that highway relative to the completion of the feasibility studies originally for Lots 1 and 2.\n",

      "As 2022 draws closer, The Stage Media (TSM) is reflecting on some of the top feats achieved this year and when we recount, it won’t be overselling to say it has been a lot but with challenges.\n",
      "in 2022 TSM will be entering its second year in August since it was established in 2020 when the Covid- 19 pandemic hit with a surge of cases in Liberia.\n",
      "Despite the surge in cases, we have achieved major milestones and thanks to a dedicated and committed team, and  donors.\n",
      "When TSM was founded, our aim has been tacklin misinformation and disinformation in Liberia and as the first Fact-checking media outlet, we gradually involved human interest stories, data analysis and investigative stories etc.\n",
      "If you have time, read some of our amazing works on fact checking stories; the National Investment commission claim on investments growth and when the Liberia Petroleum for Refining Corporation building was dedicated, we fact-checked a claim that it was the first Administrative construction\n",
      "President Weah in his Annual Message was also fact-checked and we found out there was a claim of exaggeration; understatement and misinformation.\n",
      "When the National Transport Authority Driver was hit, there was a claim that he was shot.\n",
      "A few moments for TSM in 2021, was when Premium Times and Africa Check trained Liberian Journalists in fact-checking, through a partnership.\n",
      "Did you also read our explainer on the invincible park; and a motorcyclist who was wounded by acid but could not complete the treatment because of the increased bill.\n",
      "During the height of Covid-19, facemasks made locally helped citizens combat coronavirus and despite the surge, Journalists in Liberia also explained their economic woes including old folks, market women and persons with disability.\n",
      "Electricity remains a major problem in Liberia, and in Brewerville, a project that was to be completed in two years is yet to be ended.\n",
      "A Jealous Rage also revealed how President George Weah’s claim as a Feminist in Chief remains vague.\n",
      "Do you know that we used the FOI to ascertain Senator’s assets and it was established that they escaped accounting for their wealth?\n",
      "When we first established TSM, another major investigation was on the pollution of four communities by Cemenco, watch the full documentary here.\n",
      "How we change the Reporting Narrative\n",
      "Verifying information as a journalist is one of the responsibilities whether the claim was made by a politician, journalist or a public figure. Our platform has depth in an investigative documentary, data journalism which is in the public interest. At the same time, ensuring that journalists in Liberia engage in fact-checks, data journalism.\n",
      "Donor Support\n",
      "You may know that media organizations have faced great financial difficulty due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is why support from donors who believe in your mandate and provide financial support must be acknowledged and appreciated, for, without them, many would have gone under including TSM.\n",
      "TSM’s story of survival through the height of the pandemic last year and subsequent successes in 2021 is, for instance, not complete without a mention of the aid provided by Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.\n",
      "We collaborated with Dataphyte Nigeria and the Press Union of Liberia in 2021.\n",
      "The Global Investigative Journalism Network (Africa) additionally has provided technical support to the work of TSM.\n",
      "We would like to say that the past year has shown that partnering with development organizations can set a pace for a new media institution like us in achieving institutional goals.\n",
      "Readership Growth\n",
      "TSM report this 2021 was read and thanks to social media who have helped in circulating our stories far and wide.\n",
      "Our readership has been fluctuating due to the Covid-19 and we would like to say that since Fact-check and data Journalism is apparently new to Liberia, it may take time to peak.\n",
      "Team Internal Progress\n",
      "When we were established in 2020, it was a very rocky start, we were only three and despite during Covid-19 surge, we continue to tackle misinformation and disinformation around the pandemic to help build public confidence in Covid-19 information.\n",

      "In March 2021, Liberia received  96,000  COVID-19 dosages vaccine shipped via the COVAX initiative, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO.\n",
      " The arrival of the vaccines in Liberia is part of the historic step towards achieving the goal of equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history. \n",
      "This delivery was part of the first wave of shipments that will continue to different countries in the coming days and weeks.\n",
      "So far, the Liberian government says it has given out 880 Doses and 14.9 are fully vaccinated since it kicked off its nationwide vaccination programme.\n",
      "Recently, the government also received the second Shipment of 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca Vaccine donated by the French Government.\n",
      "On August 2021 and was received by Minister of Health, Wilhemina Jallah and the US Ambassador, UNICEF officials on behalf of Liberia at the Roberts International Airport. This was followed by additional 302,400 doses of COVID-19 vaccines donated by the United States of America to help the country battle the third wave of infections\n",
      "What did the Ministry of Health say?\n",
      "The MOH said the contribution from the French government gives additional strength to Liberia’s fight against COVID-19. \n",
      "Together with the full new batch, the overall amount of the vaccines received through COVAX reached 494,400 doses as 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 302,400 doses of Johnson and Johnson were received earlier. \n",
      "What are the 2 brands of vaccines? \n",
      "Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine \n",
      "The Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine is a viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company and given by intramuscular injection. According to Medical News Today, the viral vector vaccine contains the gene that encodes for the spike protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and once delivered to the cells, the gene is transcribed, prompting our cells to make the spike protein.\n",
      " It is the presence of the protein that triggers the body’s immune system to produce antibodies to fight against the spike protein, which prepares the body to fight against Covid-19 should it enter the body. The vaccine has a shelf life of six months stored in a refrigerator between 2 to 8°C and once removed from the fridge, maybe stored between 2 to 25°C for up to six hours. \n",
      "Johnson and Johnson vaccine\n",
      "Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine is the second vaccine to be granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drugs Administration after Pfizer and Moderna. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna however, the Johnson and Johnson, like Oxford-Astrazeneca are viral vector vaccines that use a modified, harmless version of a different virus as a vector, or carrier, to deliver immunity instructions to cells in the body. The body then follows those instructions to build an immune response to the intended virus (in this case, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.)\n",
      "Between Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Johnson and Johnson\n",
      "There are few differences between the J & J and AstraZeneca which are the two vaccines that have been deployed to Liberia. All two have been granted emergency use authorization by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as well as approved for use in Liberia by the Ministry of Health.\n",
      "Oxford-AstraZeneca was the first vaccine to be administered in Liberia and according to a report by the BBC, it is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees and has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus – although it can’t cause the illness.\n",
      " The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires storage at 35.6 to 46.4 degrees F. According to the company, the vaccine is estimated to remain stable for two years at -4°F (-20°C) and a maximum of three months at routine refrigeration at temperatures of 36-46°F (2 to 8°C).\n",
      "Speaking on the vaccine, Minister Jallah said the AstraZeneca vaccine from the French government gives additional strength to Liberia’s fight against COVID-19.  \n",
      " “All the vaccines received by the government – (AstraZeneca and Janssen’s Johnson and Johnson) are safe therefore, all who are yet to receive the vaccine should do so” Dr. Jallah added.\n",
      "Together with the full new batch, the overall amount of the vaccines received through COVAX reached 494,400 doses as 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 302,400 doses of Johnson and Johnson were received earlier.\n",
      "COVAX is co-led by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, civil society organizations, manufacturers, and others.\n",
      "The Janssen Vaccines was developed in Leiden, Netherlands, and its Belgian parent company Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of American company Johnson & Johnson.\n",
      "It is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus that has been modified to contain the gene for making the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The body’s immune system responds to this spike protein to produce antibodies. The vaccine requires only one dose and does not need to be stored frozen.\n",
      "Clinical trials for the vaccine were started in June 2020, with Phase III trials involving around 43,000 people. On 29 January 2021, Janssen announced that 28 days after a completed vaccination, the vaccine was 66% effective in a one-dose regimen in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with an 85% efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19, and 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death caused by the disease.\n",
      "The vaccine has been granted by the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency (EMA and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.\n",
      " What Liberian Expert Says \n",
      "Though there are concerns over the different brands of Covid-19 vaccines imported into the country, Liberia health experts have dispelled fears over the two brands, stating the two vaccines are approved.\n",
      " Dr. Dougbeh Nyan assured Liberians that the COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of brand, as long as they have been approved by WHO, provide adequate protection against the disease.\n",
      "Dr. Nyan said, “Yes, the people should take the COVID-19 vaccines. I have consistently advised citizens to take any of the COVID-19 vaccines that are available in Liberia and the rest of Africa because this will protect lives and keep the virus from being transmitted to other people. \n",
      "“And, once we can stop (by vaccination) the virus from being transmitted, then we would have succeeded in preventing the virus from changing portion of its genes (what we called “mutation”).”\n",
      "Dr. Nyan furthers that these mutations are the cause of the variants such as the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 that is responsible for the 3rd wave of infections seen in Liberia and the world. \n",
      "“Besides, I will continue to advise citizens to wear their masks, sanitize or wash their hands, and continue to avoid gathering in large crowds. Always follow what I termed as the Four Commandments of COVID-19 Prevention. \n",
      "“That is, Thou Shall Take Your COVID-19 Vaccine, Thou Shall Wear Your Mask; Thou Shall Wash and Sanitize Your Hands; and, Thou Shall Keep Your Distance. Importantly, the government needs to continue the Community and Public Vaccination Awareness Campaign initiated by my team in April and May of 2021.”\n",
      "He encouraged parents to have their eligible children vaccinated once the vaccine becomes available. \n",
      "Dr. Jallah at the Ministry of Information’s regular press briefing on Thursday, July 29, 2021, said that those who are having weddings, church services and other gatherings should abide by the health protocols that were instituted by the Incident Management System (IMS).\n",
      "“We are seeing good news in the Covid-19 fight. Two days in the roll, we had no positive case,” Dr. Jallah disclosed.\n",
      "She added: “We are begging you, we want this thing to finish. Our recovery rate is very good. All of this good news I’m telling you does not mean you must put down your masks. We want you to wear it always.”\n",

      "At the groundbreaking ceremony, President Weah said the multipurpose park, will contain basketball courts, tennis courts, volleyball courts, walking trails, a children’s playground, and an outdoor gym, together with adequate sanitary facilities.

      "FELLOW LIBERIANS:\n",
      "Today has brought me yet another opportunity to share my dreams and aspirations for the happiness and well-being of our citizens, by providing modern recreational facilities that will contribute to their good health, wellbeing, and fitness.\n",
      "We have come to break ground for the INVINCIBLE SPORTS PARK, a multi-purpose complex that will contain basketball courts, tennis courts, volleyball courts, walking trails, a children’s playground, and an outdoor gym, together with adequate sanitary facilities. As a public park, it will be freely accessible and\n",
      "available to everyone who seeks to use it.\n",
      "Ladies and Gentlemen:\n",
      "I attended the Ellen Mills Scarborough Junior High School right across the road from here. If you look keenly you will see the school building still standing there. And I also practiced here during my days when I played for the Invincible Eleven Majestic Sports Association. I broke my first record in the high school league right here on this field by defeating the famous Wells Hairston High School when I played for the Muslim Congress High School on the other side of this airfield, called The Bench Old-Timers Field…right over there.\n",
      "So you can see that I know this area very well. This area and piece of land, unstructured and undeveloped as it was, has been used for recreational purposes for many decades by the general public in Monrovia. In fact, this is one of the first places in Monrovia where I used to practice soccer in my youthful days.\n",
      "And so it has the distinction and honour of producing the first and only Liberian and the first African to have won the World’s Best Footballer title, the Ballon d’Ór.\n",
      "You will also recall that this area has played another important and very meaningful role in our Nation’s history when it served for many years as the site where hundreds of Liberian women, wearing white, prayed for peace to return to our land. They were here as Prayer Warriors for our Nation, in the heat and in the rain, laying on the ground and sitting in the sand, with no shelter from the elements.\n",
      "And as we all now know, they were very successful. Their prayers were heard by the Almighty God, and their efforts were rewarded with a lasting and sustainable peace that we have enjoyed for almost two decades now.\n",
      "In recognition, gratitude, and appreciation of their patriotic efforts, this Park will contain a special Prayer Ground area for them to pray, which will feature turf under their feet and shelter over their heads.\n",
      "And yet, for some reasons best known to my predecessor, Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of the Republic of Liberia, chose to shut this place down, thereby denying our people the simple pleasures of recreation and relaxation in the open air. Well, just as HER job is to CLOSE it, it is MY job to OPEN it.\n",
      "Since no one cared to do anything about it after more than 30 years, it is MY job to FIX it. When she spoil it, I will FIX it.\n",
      "I, therefore, want you to know that I am developing this public park as my personal contribution to the people of this area. There will be other parks that will be built with public funds, but I feel a burning desire and sense of obligation to GIVE BACK to this community because of what this place has contributed to my success in the world of soccer.\n",
      "And let me also inform you that, before doing so, I made a formal application to the Liberian Civil Aviation Authority for approval to locate this facility here, because of its close proximity to Spriggs Airport, and permission was granted on the basis of my undertaking that all heights and elevations would comply with the requirements of the aviation regulator. Additionally, it will be situated a safe distance from the runway, as determined by the LCAA, and there will be no buildings erected in the Park.\n",
      "AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FELLOW LIBERIANS:\n",
      "Before I cut the ribbon, I just want to tell you that it does not take OPULENCE to do this. All it takes is selfless love for your people, thoughtful care for their feelings, and genuine concern for their happiness and well-being.\n",
      "So, Ladies and Gentlemen, as I break ground for this INVINCIBLE SPORTS PARK, I ask you to TRAIN WELL, BE FIT, BE INSPIRED, and DEVELOP YOUR GAME!\n",
      "I thank you.\n",
      "Verification: But on the contrary to President Weah’s promise to build the park as his “personal contribution” to the people of the Airfield Community where the park is located, it has been established that funding towards the construction of the park will come from the national budget of the country.\n",
      "In the 2022 draft budget, funding allocation to the invincible park is captured under the budget line of the Ministry of State.\n",

      "It has been a huge debate in the last two weeks both on social media and in the public about the situation of little Emmanuel Tolue who recently enrolled at the Ricks Institute in furtherance of his high school education.\n",
      "Emmanuel Tolue is the Liberia youngster who found and returned US$50,000 to its owner in Nimba County.\n",
      "Since demonstrating what many saw as huge integrity amid the thought economic times the Liberian teen has been celebrated across the world and won for himself a scholarship from President George Weah to study up to Masters Degree.\n",
      "The teen told an interview in his native Nimba County one of the counties in Liberia that prior to coming across the huge sum of money, he was a motorcycle taxi rider and have since dropped out of school for several years due to lack of support.\n",
      "After his recognition by President Weah and other institutions across Liberia, Tolue, 19, registered at the Ricks Institute and is currently in the sixth grade.\n",
      "But several social media (Facebook) users have posted claiming that the celebrated Liberian teen was demoted by the school and that he falsified his education documents taken to the institution.\n",
      "Social Media Accounts:\n",
      "Hot Spot Gist – Breaking!!!!! “Emmanuel Tolue the integrity icon has been demoted from 7th grade to 6th grade in Ricks Institute. According to the principal of the institution, Emmanuel Tolue needs to start from six (6th) grade or even below because he has been out of school for a longer period of time and his performance is low. This life em, if integrity icon cannot make it in school let the lay boy sit down and manage hi mula.”\n",
      "Dunk-News Now: Breaking News! “Despite overnight integrity icon Emmanuel Tolue disgraceful demotion by the Ricks Institute’s Administration recently, news coming in says the man of few words will receive another award in Nigeria on the 9th of December. According to the report, the overnight integrity icon was demoted for speaking very terrible and bad English mixed with Gio (Native tongue) in class.\n",
      "Bryon Bryon: “This CDC agent uncover who was recently tagged as an “Integrity Icon” has been demoted from 7th Grade to 6th Grade by Ricks Institute Board on the basis he tried to cheat on his education by taking a class he was unfit for. Some of us said that this kid was an amazing criminal, sponsored  by George Weah in order to capture Nimba COUNTY. Didn’t I say that his Koko-Story about finding money was a complete grandstand??….. Small CDC rogue!!\n",

      "Ricks Institute Acting Principal \n",
      "To verify the claims made by these social media accounts and many others, The Stage Media conducted an exclusive interview with Mr. Klahn-Gboloh Jarbah, the Acting Principal of Ricks Institute in Virginia.\n",
      "Mr. Jarbah made it clear to TSM that the school did not demote Emmanuel Tolue nor did the teen provide fake education documents to the school as claimed.\n",
      "“We do not demote here. What we did was that we asked Emmanuel to take a step back to prepare him since he was out of school for a very long time.” He said.\n",
      "“We have our benchmark that you must reach when you come to our school. If for some reason if you do not reach that benchmark we say to the parent and we say to the parent you have to take one step back so that we can prepare you for one step forward. And it is not also unusual at Ricks Institute for a student who has performed to be promoted to the next class as a double promotion in the middle of the year or at the end of the year. And the Emmanuel situation is no exception.” Jarbah says.\n",
      "“Coming to Ricks Institute from a different school particularly in the Emmanuel situation where had said to the whole world that he was out of school for so many years riding a motorcycle, so even if he was in tenth grade there will challenges for him to continue because of the longevity of time he stayed out of school.” He mentioned.\n",
      "The Acting Principal of Ricks Institute said every Liberian must begin to applaud little Emmanuel Tolue for accepting to come to Ricks Institute and noted that many in his case wouldn’t have done so.\n",
      "“It is a good thing that this young has decided to sit here at Ricks Institute among students that are even younger than he is in a class that traditionally at his age he will not sit in. I think we need to commend him. It should not be a political issue, it should not a social media issue, it should be an issue that every Liberian should applaud this young man for humanity, discipline and the willingness to do what he is doing.” Mr. Jarbah noted.\n",
      "According to him, his institution has done nothing out of the ordinary for admitting him and applying the school’s standard on him for his own good.\n",
      "Mr. Jarbah noted that Emmanuel Tolue has every opportunity to reach 8th Grade before the end of this year (2021-2021 academic year) and that will be based on his own initiative and with the help coming from the faculty and other students of the institution.\n",
      "Respond to Claims of Fake Document\n",
      "Klahn-Gboloh Jarbah, Ricks Institute Acting Principal told TSM that Tolue did not take with him any documents to the institution on grounds that he was out of school for a very long period of time while riding his motorcycle.\n",
      "“Why will anybody in 5th or 6th Grade falsify documents, to achieve what? What documents will a person of that lower call have? This is not a university, a law school or a medical school and you are trying to get it all to cost? What can he bring from Nimba county to justify or falsify any documents to enter Ricks Institute or any school for that matter? I think it is crazy that anyone will make that claim that he came here with forged documents.” He said.\n",

      "A viral post on WhatsApp claiming that messaging apps, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger,  will be shut down for seven (7) days to upgrade its servers  is FALSE\n",

      "When Facebook’s server shut down worldwide for about six hours on Monday, October 4, 2021, many businesses suffered along with it.\n",
      "The platform which also operates Instagram and WhatsApp has been playing key roles in commerce in recent times, with many Small and Medium Enterprises companies all over the world relying on Facebook’s network instead of their own websites.\n",
      "Facebook in an update later said the network that came crashing down wasn’t a hack, but rather a self-inflicted problem.\n",
      "An update to Facebook’s routers that coordinate network traffic went wrong, which sent a wave of disruptions rippling through its systems and as a result, all things connected to Facebook were effectively shut down, worldwide.\n",
      "According to Facebook, “Configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers, blocking their ability to communicate and setting off a cascade of network failures.”\n",
      "The problem was made worse because the outage also disrupted Facebook’s own internal systems and tools that it relies on for daily operations, thus making its solution more elusive, as workers were reportedly faced with difficulty in reaching the space where the routers are located.\n",

      "Due to her status as a global pop star with far-reaching influence in countries such as Nigeria, her tweet further heightened the fears of many about getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "Minaj has over 227 million followers across Instagram, Twitter and Facebook pages.\n",
      "Her claim had come at a time when several forms of misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine are making the rounds on social media in several countries including Nigeria.\n",
      "As a result of the global impact of the virus, there has been an overwhelming amount of information on social media, websites and mainstream media about the virus with a mass audience willing to consume such pieces of information.\n",
      "As with other disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic left people seeking answers to both professional and unprofessional means of prevention, symptoms, cures, and how this may possibly impact the way the world revolves.\n",
      "However, the increased access to information resulted in the spread of misinformation.\n",
      "For instance, In 2014 while the devastating Ebola epidemic raged in parts of West Africa, a viral WhatsApp broadcast prescribed bathing with or drinking salt and hot water mixtures as a “cure” for the dreaded disease.\n",
      "Even though there was no medical basis for the claim, the “prescription” went viral enough for the government to have to officially debunk it. But that ultimately proved futile, as at least two people died and several others were hospitalized over excessive salt consumption.\n",
      "The same tempo of misinformation applied to the effect of COVID-19 on Nigeria’s economy and people with influence ranging from religious leaders, among others.\n",
      "Since the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines, there have been conspiracy theories on the side effects of the vaccine on those who choose to get vaccinated.\n",
      "Nigerian televangelist Christopher Oghenebrorie Okotie, who is also Pastor of the Household of God Church International Ministries, claimed in a viral video that taking the COVID-19 vaccine would turn recipients into vampires.\n",
      "Also, the founder of LoveWorld Incorporated, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, said Christians should believe in the word of God rather than in the vaccine.\n",
      "Recently, some videos circulated the internet where some individuals alleged to have received the COVID vaccine claimed that when a LED bulb is placed against the spot where the vaccine is injected, it lights up. These claims have however been debunked.\n",
      "Therefore, Minaj’s tweet has continued to ignite debate on the possible dangers of taking the vaccine across the world.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people against severe disease and death from variants of the virus.\n",
      "The centre acknowledges that after taking the vaccine, there is a probability of developing side effects, but noted that such is only temporary.\n",
      "It also revealed that common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines on people include: pain, redness and swelling on the spot where one gets injected. It added that those who have received the vaccine may experience tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea.\n",
      "“Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination,” it said.\n",
      "It, however, explicitly states that the vaccine does not affect impotence and swelling of the testicles as Minaj’s tweet claimed.\n",
      "It said: “Currently no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause male fertility problems. A recent small study of 45 healthy men who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) looked at sperm characteristics, like quantity and movement, before and after vaccination. Researchers found no significant changes in these sperm characteristics after vaccination.\n",
      "“Fever from illness has been associated with a short-term decrease in sperm production in healthy men. Although fever can be a side effect of COVID-19 vaccination, there is no current evidence that fever after COVID-vaccination affects sperm production.”\n",
      "Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago Health Minister, Terrence Deyalsingh, has dismissed Minaj’s claim, describing the musician’s tweet as “false.”\n",
      "“As we stand now, there is absolutely no reported such side effect or adverse event of testicular swelling in Trinidad or, I dare say, anywhere else in the world,” he said.\n",
      "In an interview with CNN, Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to Joe Biden, US president, also faulted Minaj’s claim, saying her claim lacks evidence.\n",
      "“There’s no evidence that it happens, nor is there any mechanistic reason to imagine that it would happen. So the answer to your question is no,” he said.\n",
      "“There’s a lot of misinformation, mostly on social media, and the only way we know to counter mis- and disinformation is to provide a lot of correct information.\n",
      "“To essentially debunk these kinds of claims, which may be innocent on her part, I’m not blaming her for anything, but she should be thinking twice about propagating information that really has no basis.”\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Nicki Minaj’s tweet suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine could lead to impotence and swelling of the testicles is false. There is no scientific evidence to substantiate such a claim.\n",

It lists the most valuable organs. According to this alert, a kidney is said to cost $262,000, a heart, $119,000, and a liver $157,000. (See screengrab below).\n",

      "“The black market for parts of the human body is booming in the Middle East. A kidney now costs 262,000 dollars (131 million CFA francs); the heart costs 119,000 dollars(60 million CFA francs) and the liver costs 157,000 dollars (79 million CFA francs). Beware of fake foreign agencies promising to make you work abroad. They process your papers, pay your plane ticket and just take you abroad pretending they want to find you a job, but instead, they kill their victims, recover all the precious parts of their bodies. Many people have been offered jobs in the Middle East and so far their families have been unable to locate them. SHARE TO SAVE LIVES\n",
      "However, the claim is false. The purported alert is fabricated, and the UN denied it issued any such alert.\n",
      "Verification: First, we checked a link shared by this alert, and the results show that it is faulty. However, it mimics an archived link from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n",
      "The difference between the two is the former gives an alert of a black market for organ trafficking in the Middle East, giving prices of these organs.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: Frequently shaving or waxing one’s pubic hair could lead to cuts which in turn aids infection when not properly treated and this can also dampen a woman’s arousal during sexual intercourse.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "An online medium Trojan News posted an article of a gynecologist, Dr. Jen Gunther, urging women not to remove their pubic hair.\n",
      "In the article, the gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible were quoted as saying “waxing or shaving creates microscopic trauma that can lead to infections.”\n",
      "“Getting a Brazilian may also reduce pleasure, with the pubic hair being connected to nerve endings that might help arousal,” Dr. Gunter added.\n",
      "Screenshot of the post\n",
      "Pubic Hair\n",
      "Pubic hair is basically body hair that is found and located in the genital area of human beings. The hair is present on and around the sexual organs. It is found in the scrotum (male) and vulva (female).\n",
      "Over the years, having a bare and smooth skin has become a common practice for people all over the world regardless of their gender. This practice, just as in some climes, has become a norm to have the public hair removed and is often regarded as part of personal hygiene.\n",
      "And as such, it has become a routine for some women to shave or wax their hair especially around the private part. Though the removal of pubic hair is generally safe, there are some common side effects. These include:\n",
      "-Itching\n",
      "-Cuts\n",
      "-Rashes\n",
      "-Infections\n",
      "-Burns from chemical removers\n",
      "So, those waxing and shaving of a woman’s pubic hair cause microscopic trauma leading to infections.\n",
      "Microscopic Trauma\n",
      "Microscopic trauma which is also known as microtrauma is basically any small injury that is usually one of a series that can lead to major injuries. It can include the micro-tearing of muscle fibers, the sheath around the muscle, and the connective tissue.\n",
      "Microscopic injuries are overuse injuries from persistent and repetitive motions that can cause microscopic damage, muscle and connective tissue imbalances that can over time alter and limit activities. The area of injury undergoes a mechanical stress reaction that may sometimes include microtears, inflammation, swelling, and tenderness, usually in a pointed area.\n",
      "Early microtrauma may not be detectable, obvious, painful, or have any swelling. However, as the overuse continues with time, the microscopic imbalance becomes extreme, and extra tear weakens the flesh while tissue degeneration increases until symptoms or physical limitations manifest.\n",
      "Can waxing and shaving of the pubic hair cause microscopic trauma leading to infections and reducing arousal for a woman?\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "A Consultant Gynecologist with the University of Medical sciences teaching hospital, Ondo (UNIMEDTH), Dr. Olukayode Lawal, said microscopic trauma occurs when the pubic hair is removed often.\n",
      "According to him, ‘For every cycle of shaving, in the course of the regrowth of hair, there is a tendency that the rate at which the various hair growth occurs could be a point or site for infection. Depending on the method used to get rid of the pubic hair, one could either suffer a cut or injury, so as much as one sweats or inserts a foreign object in that area, it could lead to a risk of infection. If one has unprotected sex, it could be a source of sexually transmitted infection.’\n",
      "While reacting to the claim that waxing could reduce pleasure, Dr. Lawal said every structure in that perennial region is well vascularized and so could be easily stimulated and as such a cut in that region could lead to pain during sex, thus increasing the possibility of contacting sexual infection.\n",
      "Dr Lawal, however, advised that women should limit the removal of their pubic hair and only do so when it is well grown.\n",
      "A Gynecologist, Dr. Victor Adefesoye, said there is an average possibility of waxing and shaving of the pubic hair causing microscopic trauma which could lead to infections.\n",
      "“There is a 50-50 chance of this happening and that is because if one has a cut in the pubic area and such is not well taken care of, it could lead to infections. However, it is not true in cases, where the removal of pubic hair does not leave an injury behind. So, if there is an injury, it could lead to infection sometimes, only if not well taken care of.”\n",
      "While also speaking on the possibility of pubic hair removal reducing pleasure, Dr. Adefesoye said there would be reduced arousal if the woman suffers an injury in the course of shaving or waxing the public area.\n",
      "“If there is a cut in the public region and she is engaged in a sexual activity, the cut could be painful to the woman and that could reduce the woman’s libido thereby leading to reduced pleasure,” he said.\n",
      "He, therefore, opined that cuts or injuries suffered during the removal of pubic hair could reduce sexual pleasure.\n",
      "Studies have also shown that grooming one’s pubic hair can be harmful to one’s health as one-quarter of people who shave or wax are injuring themselves. The biggest risk in getting nicked while removing pubic hair is that small cuts can let in bacteria. Researchers also found a link between more frequent grooming and sexually transmitted diseases, such as herpes or syphilis.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Frequently shaving or waxing one’s pubic hair could lead to cuts which in turn aid infection when not properly treated and this can also dampen a woman’s arousal during sexual intercourse.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More context is needed. While there exists some record that corn silk helps in promoting wellbeing, there is insufficient information about dosage and duration of treatment to cure specific diseases.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "There is a paradigm shift from Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), (which involves the use of only evidence-based methods and medications in treating patients) to a nutrition based approach in which many experts and private individuals promote general wellness and disease prevention/treatment using food and other locally available herbs and spices.\n",
      "While nutrition plays a significant role in health and wellbeing, there is insufficient evidence that food can be used to cure serious diseases like cancer and other major illnesses once they occur.\n",
      "A viral video that has been forwarded many times on WhatsApp in Nigeria claims that corn silk cures many diseases. The 35 seconds video shows a woman demonstrating how to prepare corn silk for treatment. She asks viewers to “boil some water, put in the corn silk, turn off the stove and let it simmer for 30 minutes and drink the water”. She went on to say that the mixture is very good for curing “bladder infection, kidney stones, heart failure, inflammation of the prostate, urinary system, and diabetes.” She ended by noting that “simple things in life will give healing, it’s all about life changes” and encourages everyone to “try it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Screenshot of the viral video on WhatsApp\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "Dubawa searched TikTok and found the video on Sharon’s page. She uses @eden.health and has 548,000 followers and 2 million likes. Her philosophy is “Let Food Be Your Medicine and Medicine be your Food.”\n",
      "Dubawa searched her page and discovered that the corn silk video was recorded in two parts; the second part has been watched over 515,000 times, gained over 24,000 likes and shared 2,550 times. The only new information in the “CornSilk: Part 2” video is her recommendation that viewers drink 1 to 2 cups in a day at room temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Screenshot of the Part 2 of the corn silk video on TikTok\n",
      "Many of Sharon’s followers confirmed that they remembered their Asian grandparents taking corn silk tea, some were eager to try out the ‘health’ recipe while others were curious about its efficacy.\n",
      "What is Corn Silk and what does it do?\n",
      "Corn silks are the “long shiny and silky fibers that grow inside the husks of ears of corn.” They are the “yellowish thread-like strands from the female flower of the corn/maize plant.” Corn silk has been used as medicinal herbs in Asia for a long time.\n",
      "In a 2012 study published in Molecules, Hasanudin, Hashim and Mustafa assert that corn silk can serve as an antioxidant, anti-depressant, anti-fatigue, a diuretic agent and can help reduce hyperglycemia – thereby confirming the claims made by Sharon in her TikTok video. The researchers, however, concluded their study by noting that “it is important to carry out clinical evaluations to substantiate the claims and further enhance the confidence in its beneficial therapeutic effects for human consumption”. This means that the researchers recognize the need for further research to approve the product for human beings.\n",
      "Also, researchers Maksimović, Malencić and Kovacević, in their 2005 study published on Bioresour Technol, while confirming the benefits of corn silk, highlight the need for the herbal drug derived from corn silk “to be more precisely defined,” as observed activities and micronutrients contents “were greatly dependent on plant material source,” which means that there are differences in the components of the various corn silks that people may have access to, which will ultimately influence the benefits they can derive from it. This position is also the conclusion by other researchers in a 2015 study published in the journal, Food Chemistry.\n",
      "Commenting on the suitability of corn silk for consumption and treatment of diseases, an Associate Professor of Botany, Dr. Akeem Babalola Kadiri, a lecturer in the Botany Department of the University of Lagos said while corn silk is indicated for the treatment of many diseases, including optical conditions like glaucoma, “all of the claims still require scientific proof.”\n",
      "A Senior Lecturer in the Department of Botany, also in the University of Lagos, Dr. Temitope Onuminya, told Dubawa that most studies about the efficacy of corn silk have been conducted in mice and not on humans. She also noted that corn silk,  “when taken in high doses, can cause liver toxicity” and “interfere with the medications that patients are using in treating diabetes, as well as high and low blood pressure.”\n",
      "However, Dr. Onuminya notes that daily doses as high as 4.5 grams per pound of body weight (10 grams per kg) are likely safe for most people. Corn silk is available as a supplement in some countries and she recommends taking a maximum dosage of “400-450 milligrams 2-3 times per day.” She however warned that a dose of more than 2,000 mg/kg can be lethal.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "More context is required about whether regulatory authorities and researchers have agreed that consuming corn silk is safe for use by humans, as most studies on corn silk have been conducted on mice. There is also a need to clarify the type of corn silk that can be used (corn silk tea or its manufactured supplements), and how they can be used without people harming themselves and others close to them.\n",

      "When Solicitor General (SG) Cephus appeared on OK FM, on August 2, 2021, he claimed that  “82.2 percent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding our civil war.”\n",
      "Cllr Cephus in an interview said his source was the TRC report.\n",
      "“You have to read the report, it is stated there, my reliance is the TRC,” he said.\n",
      "In Liberia, there have been calls from both local and international countries for the establishment of a war crimes court to bring justice to those bearing higher responsibility for Liberia’s more than a decade-long bloody civil war.\n",
      "But the SG says 82.2% of Liberians agreed to transitional justice instead of a war crimes court.\n",
      "Councilor Cephus also claimed that in the absence of what he calls total stability, the government would not opt for the establishment of such a tribunal.\n",
      "Liberia went through civil crises which resulted in the destruction of lives and properties, including the loss of approximately 250,000 lives and the displacement of thousands of Liberians, when a crisis engulfed the country in 1989.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "This researcher perused the Truth Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report which the SG said he relied on and found that although there were palava huts on transitional justice forums, there was no mention of the percentage of Liberians who opted for it.\n",
      "Fubbi Henries, a War Crimes Court activist, also says there has been no survey conducted in Liberia to ascertain the total number of people who preferred transitional justice.\n",
      "“The claim is a lie,” he said in reaction to the claim.\n",
      "At the same time, Tennen Dalieh, a doctoral student at Dublin City University researching universal jurisdiction, transitional justice, peacebuilding and reconciliation in Liberia, said in an interview that there is no record of 82 percent of Liberians consenting to transitional justice.\n",
      "“There is absolutely no record that 82 percent agreed to transitional justice,” Dalieh said.\n",
      "Background \n",
      "The Senate endorsed the recommendation of its leadership committee to set up a Transitional Justice Commission (TJC).\n",
      "The plenary action of TJC came as a response to the request of President George Weah for advice on how his administration should proceed in handling the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).\n",
      "The unanimous decision was taken by the senate after expert opinions and inputs were solicited from the Solicitor General of Liberia, Saymah Syrenius Cephus, the Liberian National Bar Association and other interested parties.\n",
      "The TJC is to analyze the TRC report and give further recommendations to the President.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "There is no evidence that 82.2 percent of the Liberian population opted for transitional justice or the palaver hut discussion to settle issues surrounding Liberia’s civil war. According to the TRC report, though there were town hall meetings, there is no record that 82 percent of Liberians opted for transitional justice.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no scientific evidence establishing that sleeping at night without light helps to fight disease in the body, boost human intelligence, or make people look younger than people sleeping with light. Meanwhile, sleeping generally helps to boost the immune system and reposition the cells.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "A viral WhatsApp message said to have been written by one Dr. Akin itemized the benefits of sleeping without light. In the message, the writer, who cannot be authenticated whether as a medical doctor or health expert and whose first name is not available, claimed that to sleep without night allows the “body to be able to produce a hormone called Melatonin which fights diseases.”\n",
      "The writer of the message also claimed that “study shows that intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights on.”\n",
      "This message has been shared and re-shared on WhatsApp on a leading micro-messaging platform used to spread misinformation in the world.\n",
      "It reads:\n",
      "“HEALTH BENEFITS OF SLEEPING WITHOUT LIGHT  ~Dr. Akin \n",
      "1) The body is able to produce a hormone (Melatonin) which fights diseases in the body while asleep at night in the dark only.\n",
      "2) While asleep in the dark, the brain cells are able to rejuvenate back to their original state ( cells which were damaged due to excessive sunlight and electricity) and function properly. \n",
      "3) A study shows that Intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights on. Take note\n",
      "4) Sleeping in the dark or without light at night, helps the body to fight Insomnia (check the meaning)\n",
      "5) Melatonin decreases in the day time due to the presence of sun light. Hence you should not allow light at night when the body is ready to produce it again. \n",
      "6) Melatonin tells us its time to sleep. Lack of it causes sleeplessness.\n",
      "7) Sleeping without light at night, makes an individual look fresh, lives longer and looks younger all the times. (Healthy).\n",

      "\n",
      "Screenshot of the viral WhatsApp message. Credit: Rahaman Abiola\n",
      "What is Melatonin which the writer/sender mentioned 3 times in his message?\n",
      "According to the National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), a United States agency, Melatonin is a hormone the brain produces in response to darkness.  It helps with the timing of circadian rhythms (24-hour internal clock) and with sleep.\n",
      "Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night and has long been associated with control of the sleep-wake cycle.\n",
      "In their paper titled Melatonin as a Hormone: New Physiological and Clinical Insights, José Cipolla-Neto and Fernanda Gaspar do Amaral argued that the hormone is “a ubiquitous molecule present in almost every living being from bacteria to humans.”\n",
      "The UK National Health Service (NHS) stated that the hormone can be “manmade”, that is its supplement can be made to fight “short-term sleep problems (insomnia).”\n",
      "Melatonin supplement has also been confirmed to help with certain conditions, such as jet lag, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, some sleep disorders in children, and anxiety before and after surgery.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "\n",
      "Does Melatonin fight disease in the body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Melatonin, produced at night, has been established to be significant to the sleep-wake cycle. It helps to fight insomnia and other disorders in the body. However, there is no scientific proof that it fights disease.\n",
      "Naturally, the body is created with an immune system function known as “antibodies” which fight invaders such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins (chemicals produced by microbes).\n",
      "This is made up of different organs, cells, and proteins that work together. And it can be classified into two: The innate immune system (which every individual is born with); and the adaptive immune system (which one develops when the body is exposed to microbes or chemicals released by microbes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Does a study show that intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights on?\n",
      "\n",
      "This looks like an exaggeration. There is no scientific study that established that “intelligent people all over the world do not sleep at night with lights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Does sleeping without light at night make an individual look fresh, live longer and look younger all the time?\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness is essential to sleep which is coordinated by the Melatonin hormone discussed above.\n",
      "Melatonin, known as the hormone of sleep or darkness, “sends a critical signal to the body that it is time to rest.\n",
      "While sleeping itself settles the body and rearranges the cells, there is no scientific proof that sleeping without light contributes to the freshness of the body or the extension of lifespan.\n",
      "Science has naturally attributed young-looking to “genes”, a basic physical and functional unit of heredity made up of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n",
      "DNA is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses.\n",
      "A study by the World Health Organisation on “health and ageing” showed that other factors that can contribute to “staying younger” and looking fresh are diets (consumption of vitamins, fruits and vegetables), regular exercise, regular rest, and taking water (good for digestion).\n",
      "Experts’ opinion\n",
      "When contacted, a health expert at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Teaching Hospital, Dr Lukman Adefabi, explained that Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland, a small, pea-shaped gland located in the brain.\n",
      "“Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleeping-awake cycle. It’s produced in higher quantities in the morning. But when the sun rises, or there is a body exposure to light, the production rate of the hormone can be reduced. Melatonin also increases its production in the evening when the sun is set,” he explained.\n",
      "Dr. Adefabi emphasized further that the “major function” of the Melatonin hormone is to regulate the sleep cycle which he also said its supplement can be used to tackle insomnia when one is experiencing sleeplessness.\n",
      "He added that there is no proof that people who sleep without light are intelligent.\n",
      "It’s misleading\n",
      "According to Dr. Opeyemi Yakubu of the University Teaching Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, claims that people who sleep at night without light are intelligent is “misleading.”\n",
      "He also added that Melatonin does not fight disease. It only contributes to part of the substance that controls sleep.\n",
      "“Though melatonin forms part of the substance that controls the circadian rhythm, the information contained in the write-up (the viral WhatsApp claim) is not entirely true. So, it is misleading\n",
      "“Intelligence and sleep without night have no correlation,” he said.\n",
      "Circadian rhythms, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), are physical, mental, and behavioural changes that follow a 24-hour cycle.\n",
      "These natural processes respond primarily to light and dark and affect most living things, including animals, plants, and microbes.\n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "Darkness or sleeping without light is significant to the production of the Melatonin hormone responsible for the sleeping-awake cycle and fighting insomnia. However, there is no scientific research that links sleeping without light to intelligence or youthfulness.\n",

      "Liberia’s Freedom of Information (FOI) Act was signed into law on September 16, 2010. It grants everyone the right to access public records and information. The law fulfills provisions guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights and the Liberian constitution to have access to public information.\n",
      "This article is not a comprehensive explanation of the FOI legislation but aims to assist readers in understanding the advantages of the law to everyone. Please keep in mind that this publication is based on the Freedom of Information Act, the Carter Center’s citizen guide to FOI legislation, and frequently asked questions.\n",
      "What kind of information can I request? \n",
      "Any kind of information may be requested, whether it is in written, printed, audio, visual, or electronic form. Specifically, this includes any document that has been created, received, utilized, controlled, and/or held by any government agency or private organization that distributes or receives public money. They include details regarding an agency’s operations, such as its activities, budgets, and expenditures – how much money was received, spent, and on what – agency policies and decisions, as well as the rationale and explanation for the decision, statistical data, administrative staff manuals laws, rules, and regulations legislation and regulations. \n",
      "How can I learn where to obtain information? \n",
      "The FOI legislation requires all public authorities to develop and maintain a user-friendly and publicly available “publication scheme” that contains comprehensive information about their basic duties, the nature of their activities and operations, and the kinds of documents/information they possess.\n",
      "More specifically, the publication scheme should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Contact information for the authority’s information officer;\n",
      "A clear description of the agency’s organization, function, and powers, as well as an explanation of how it makes decisions and discloses the information;\n",
      "The location and types of categories of documents and information that the agency holds;\n",
      "And procedures for accessing documents or information.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are unsure which authority has the information you want, you may consult the publishing scheme, contact the information officer at the agency you believe holds the information, or simply submit your request with the agency. If you submitted your request in the incorrect location, the agency is obliged to transfer it to the right agency. The information officer is responsible for assisting you in submitting requests and receiving information.\n",
      "Can I obtain information without needing to file a request? \n",
      "According to the legislation, some information must be made accessible to the public without the need to request information, according to the legislation. Information that is made accessible without the need for a request is termed “automatically published” or “proactively disclosed,” information and public bodies are obliged to make this information available through a website or physical publication. The types of documents subject to the automatic publication include legislation, existing policies, procedures and rules, and budgets.\n",
      "How can I file a request for information?\n",
      "You may submit a request for information in writing via electronic mail, verbally, or by any other means permitted by law. However, the request should be detailed enough to allow the public agency or private organization to readily identify the material you want. If this is not done, the public or private organization should engage with you to explain what information you are seeking.\n",
      "You are not required to give a reason for requesting the information. The agency should not inquire as to why you want the information or how you intend to utilize it. You own the public information. You may submit a request for information to the public or private organization that you believe has the information you want. It is up to that agency or entity to transfer the request if they do not have the required information and to notify you of where they have moved your request. Requesting information should be as simple as possible, with no paperwork or formalities required. If you need assistance, the agency’s information officer is available to help. As mentioned in the preceding section on automatic publishing, certain information may already be accessible without the need to submit a request.\n",
      "Will I be charged for the information?\n",
      "The FOI Law mandates that applications for information and searches be free of charge. The required papers are also available for free viewing. If you want a copy of the document, however, they may charge you for the actual cost of reproducing the requested material, such as photocopying, transcribing, scanning, or other kinds of reproduction. If you believe you were overcharged for the reproduction of the requested material, or if the agency attempted to charge you for anything else, you may seek an internal review of the decision. During an internal review, a senior official or review body will examine the fees imposed to see if they are legal. If you are still dissatisfied, you have the option of filing a complaint with the information commissioner. It costs nothing to inquire for information. Only the actual expenses of recreating the documents you request may be charged to you.\n",
      "After filing a request, what should I expect to happen next?\n",
      "Once you have submitted a request for information, the agency must begin processing it. Each agency may establish its own internal processing rules, but in general, the process starts with the agency noting the date your request was received, confirming receipt of your request, evaluating the request, and deciding if the information you want is kept inside the agency.\n",
      "In most cases, upon receiving a request for information, the information officer or other designated public servant should:\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide you with written confirmation that your request for information has been received and tell you the maximum number of days it should take to respond to your request.\n",
      "Check to see whether it has the information you’re looking for, and if not, send your request to the appropriate organization.\n",
      "Give you one of the following responses: inspection or copy of the requested information written rejection of request notification of request transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When will I receive a response?\n",
      "Within thirty (30) calendar days, the agency must respond to all requests for information by post, e-mail, or hand delivery. If the agency can demonstrate good cause, it may extend the deadline for replying once. The one-time extension is for a maximum of thirty (30) days. The agency must accept your request and respond within 30 days, or document. According to the legislation, if the agency does not have the information you requested, it may transmit your request to the appropriate public agency or private business once within fifteen (15) days. If the agency to whom your request was moved does not have the information you need, your request may be transferred one more time, but it must be transmitted within ten (10) working days (approximately two weeks) after receipt. The agency moving the request must notify you where the request has been moved each time it is transferred, up to a maximum of two (2) times.\n",
      "Can my request be lawfully denied? \n",
      "Yes. According to the FOI law’s “exemption clause,” a request for information may be rejected ONLY if the material sought comes under one of the exclusions listed in the FOI legislation and the damage of revealing the requested information outweighs the public’s interest in viewing the document. Except in the case of transfers, all rejections must be in writing, provide a rationale for the refusal, and be sent to you within thirty (30) calendar days of the day the request was submitted.\n",
      "What are the exemptions included in the FOI Act?\n",
      "According to the Liberian Freedom of Information Act, a document, information, or record is excluded from public access ONLY if its publication will cause damage or significant harm to:\n",
      "\n",
      "National security, defence, or international relations\n",
      "Criminal Investigation\n",
      "Trade Secrets\n",
      "Privileged communications\n",
      "\n",
      "When it would be an unreasonable revelation of personal information, a document is excluded from the general right of access to information. Your request will be rejected only if the material comes under an exemption and the damage of disclosure outweighs the public interest. In most cases, personal information is excluded from dissemination. To meet the public interest test, the agency must demonstrate the following: the requested information falls under one or more of the exemptions listed in the FOI Act; disclosure of the information will or is likely to cause injury or substantial harm to the interests protected by the exemptions, and the harm to be caused is greater than the benefit to be gained if the information is provided.\n",
      "What if I am not satisfied with the agency response or the agency does not respond?\n",
      "If you are still dissatisfied, you have the right to file an appeal with the Independent Information Commissioner. The information commissioner is obliged to examine your appeal request and make a final judgement. It is essential to remember that you do not need an attorney or a lawyer to request an internal review or to file an appeal with the Independent Information Commissioner. Throughout the appeals process, the agency must demonstrate that its judgement is lawful under FOI legislation. If your request is rejected due to an exemption, the agency must demonstrate that disclosing the material you sought will cause significant damage to the public that outweighs the benefit.\n",
      "What if I am still not satisfied?\n",
      "If you are still not satisfied with the Information Commissioner’s judgement, you have the right to seek judicial review before the Civil Law Court in Montserrado County and the Circuit Court in the county where the public agency or private business is situated.\n",

      "Messi in 'Divork Origi' Shirt\n",
      "Claim: “Can anyone see wat is writing in Messi shirt? Divork Origi do de finishing, Assisted by Arnold”\n",
      "\n",
      "Full Text: Since the announcement of the departure of Lionel Messi from FC Barcelona, ​​several internet users have fun posting that the Argentine star has signed with several teams, namely Arsenal, Liverpool etc, but his arrival in Paris, France, social media users, specifically Liverpool supporters have circulated an image of Messi wearing a shirt of Divork Origi with inscription “Corner taken quickly. Liverpool 4- 0 Barcelona, 07-03-2019- champions league. Beware of this satire.\n",
      "Lionel Messi could not renew with FC Barcelona and has signed a two-year with the French club Paris Saint-Germain.\n",
      "Verification: Reversed image search, Yandex, Tineye and Google image used for verification established that the image was a retouched work and the photo used in this post is a montage made with the aim of showing that Lionel Messi wore a shirt with Divork Origi written front.\n",
      "In the photo, we see the Argentine star holding a red object in one hand, while the other is on a rope.\n",
      "In the original photo, Messi is holding an object but not as red as in the retouched image while there is a man at his back with a phone in his hand.\n",
      "The real shirt of Messi is written- l C l C’ EST- Paris, the photo was taken August 10, 2021, the day he landed in Paris.\n",
      "Radio France International (RFI) published an article with the original image with the caption Lionel Messi hailed fans at Le Bourget airport near Paris after arriving from Barcelona to sign a contract with Paris Saint-Germain. REUTERS – YVES HERMAN.\n",
      "HCA Barbieri News carried a similar story with the original picture on August 10, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yandex, Tineye and Bing found no image but Google image reverse led us to RFI and HCA Barbieri news.\n",
      "Conclusion: The image with Messi wearing an Origi shirt, the Liverpool star is fake. At the same time, Liverpool did not beat Barcelona 4-0 on 07-03-2019. The 4-0 result was 8-6-16 in the international champion cup.\n",
      "Though both teams clashed on 5-7-19, the result was 4-3 in the champions league and not 4-0 as seen on the shirt.\n",

      "False: Sim Swap Fraud Alert Message Impossible, Not From UBA Liberia\n",
      "The Stage Media-Liberia\n",
      "\n",
      "By: Josephine Wreh\n",
      "Claim: A WhatsApp message purportedly originating from the United Bank for Africa and alerting customers of fraud has been widely circulated on both WhatsApp and Messenger generating tons of reactions. \n",
      "The Management of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Liberia has denied that the message originated from the bank.\n",
      "Full Text\n",
      "A viral WhatsApp message which claimed to have originated from the United Bank of Africa warns customers about a new High Tech Fraud called “Sims Swap Fraud.” The scam is said to have victimized hundreds of people already.\n",
      "The message warns: Your Bank Account could be emptied without an Alert.  Dear All, Please let’ be very careful.. There is a new HIGH TECH FRAUD in town called the SIM SWAP FRAUD, and hundreds of persons are already VICTIMS.”\n",
      "How does it work?  1. A new fraud called SIM SWAP has started. Your phone network will momentarily go blind / zero (No Signal / Zero Bars) and after a while a call will come through.  2. The Person on the other end of the call will tell you that he is calling from (your cell phone company) depending on your network and that there is a problem in your mobile network.  3. He will instruct you to please press 1 on your phone to get the network back.  – Please at this stage don’ to Press anything, just cut or END the call. If you press 1, the network will appear suddenly and almost immediately go blind again (Zero Bars) and by that action, your phone is #HACKED.  Within a second, they will empty your bank account, and you won’t receive any alert. \n",
      "The alert warns further, What you will experience. It will appear as though your line is without Network; meanwhile your SIM has been SWAPPED.  The danger here is that you will not get any alert of any transactions, so please those of us doing USSD Banking and Mobile Banking BEWARE.  Let’sbe very careful.  Please, forward to your contacts, loved ones and friends. \n",
      "The fraud is increasing day by day. And it ended by encouraging all to share the message “Don’t forget to share this post…… I repeat don’t forget to share this post. Many people’s Account has been emptied! #UBAcares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "In our effort to verify the authenticity of the claim, we contacted Emmanuel K. Barnes, the Branch Manager of UBA Liberia for Redlight Branch, to verify the source of the claim but Barnes denied that the message originated from the Bank.\n",
      "“We are not the ones sending such messages, whatever message we have for our customers, we would send through phone number directly or post it on our Facebook page which is called UBA Liberia,” he said.\n",
      "He added that the system at the UBA is well built which makes it highly improbable for hackers to access and penetrate.\n",
      "Also, the head of Digital Marketing at UBA Liberia, Momolu Momo, said the bank has already received numerous calls from customers on the fraud alert but had informed them that the alert did not come from the Bank.\n",
      "“Some of our customers called to find out why some of them did not receive the message on their phones but instead seeing it on social media platforms, but we told them it was not from us,” he said.\n",
      "Our reporter also spoke with the communications manager at Orange Liberia Betty Flahn, one of Liberia’s leading GSM companies who said that it is impossible to swap a person’s sim with just a phone call.\n",
      "In an interview via phone, Liberian IT expert Lauren E. A. Kolleh added that the swapping of sim cards does not work by just a phone call.\n",
      "“Before you swap a sim the person’s phone has to be in your hands, without that it is impossible.”\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Based on the UBA Liberia management findings, we have concluded that the Fraud Alert message circulating on Messenger and WhatsApp that the message did not originate from UBA Liberia as mentioned in the claim.\n",

      "Liberia must fight its fake news epidemic to fight the pandemic\n",
      "The Stage Media-Liberia\n",
      "\n",
      "Distributing COVID-19 relief packages in Liberia. Credit: IDWF.\n",
      "Covid conspiracy theories are rife in Liberia. To handle this and future crises, the government will have to tackle this problem from its roots.\n",
      "\n",
      " IBRAHIM AL-BAKRI NYEI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a startling Afrobarometer survey earlier this year, 66% of Liberians said they are “unlikely” to try to get vaccinated against COVID-19. An even higher 86% said they believe “prayer is more effective than a vaccine in preventing coronavirus infection”.\n",
      "Much of these attitudes are due to fake news or misinformation. These problems are not new to Liberia, but there is no doubt they have escalated recently. The increase in internet penetration and social media use – particularly among younger urban dwellers – has allowed false information to spread further and faster than ever before. Meanwhile, two major events in 2020 saw enormous fake news campaigns.\n",
      "The first began when Liberia announced its first recorded case of COVID-19 on 16 March. Immediately, the conspiracy theories swirled. One was that the government had faked the case to solicit international aid. When a government official then caught the disease, it was alleged the individual was being willingly used as a pawn in a wider scheme. This early misinformation contributed to the fact that when the Liberian government imposed a lockdown in April, few people abided by the restrictions until the military violently enforced them.\n",
      "The second event was the special senatorial elections in December 2020. With Liberian politics deeply polarised between a government that considers its opponents “enemies of the country” and an opposition that sees of the current administration as “kleptocratic and politically corrupt”, these polls saw each side unleash their propaganda machinery. Political activists – some referred to as “cyber warriors” and “intellectual guerrillas” – created Facebook pages on which they maligned rival candidates by spreading spurious information about their personal lives. They also then published fake election results that put their candidates in the lead, confusing the public and undermining trust in the official results.\n",
      "Liberian authorities, health workers and civil society organizations have faced a range of challenges in tackling the pandemic, including official corruption and vaccine hoarding by Western nations. But this epidemic of fake news, which has continued unabated in 2021, cannot be understated. When Liberia launched its COVID-19 vaccination programme this April, it was accompanied by another flurry of unfounded conspiracy theories. These made claims such as that the vaccine would cause infertility in women, kill men two years after being jabbed, or inject a magnetic sensor in those vaccinated. Others went as far as claiming the vaccine was sent to Africa to reduce the population.\n",
      "Worryingly, this fake news has contributed to hesitancy around other vaccines too. Health authorities are reportedly now struggling to carry out routine vaccinations for children, with some parents wrongly suspecting that the government is delivering the COVID-19 vaccine under the guise of polio and measles inoculation.\n",
      "Challenging fake news\n",
      "Under these circumstances, Liberia will struggle to fight COVID-19 – and future crises – effectively. But curtailing the influence of fake news is easier said than done. Some local media organizations such as The Stage Media and Local Voices Liberia actively FactCheck dubious claims to combat misinformation, but they are up against a tide of thousands of accounts spreading new false claims through social media and group chats every day. Global social media companies arguably have an obligation to tackle fake news on their platforms, but this is out of Liberia’s control.\n",
      "To truly tackle the problem now and in the long-term where it can, the Liberian government will need to address its roots. One of these is the long history of distrust between the people and administrations that over-promise and under-deliver. As a result of countless broken promises, many Liberians associate politicians with falsehoods and are open to believing those who accuse authorities of lying.\n",
      "To overcome this deficit of trust in the short term, the government will have to be much more transparent about its activities and decisions, and it will have to rely even more heavily on individuals and groups that already enjoy greater legitimacy among target communities. In previous crises and during this pandemic, Liberia has employed the support of local organizations and religious and traditional leaders to lead public information campaigns and interventions. These have often proven invaluable, though, in an era of ever-more-ubiquitous fake news, the task is more daunting and will require greater support, access to information and resources.\n",
      "To truly combat fake news in the long term, however, Liberia will need to recognize the role of its high levels of illiteracy and poverty in the spread of misinformation. Fake news tends to thrive in environments where people have limited capacity to read and write, must rely on others for public information, and lack the resources to research and access credible sources. These conditions when added to general trust in the internet as a reliable source of information – particularly when “google” or “Wikipedia” are cited – have given purveyors of fake news a huge advantage.\n",
      "A meaningful and sustainable intervention therefore must include serious investments in public education and poverty reduction as well as attempts to rebuild trust in an accountable governing system. These promises are of course made during every election, but rarely have the dangers of under-resourced public services and mistrust in authorities been as clearly highlighted as in this fake news pandemic.\n",
